A nun from [Savorra](Savorra) whose actions and demeanor through the horrors she experienced led to her being venerated as a saint by the church of [Rethianity](../World/Organizations/Religions%20&%20Cults/Rethianity), a kami by [The Open Hand](../World/Organizations/Religions%20&%20Cults/The%20Open%20Hand) with a shrine dedicated to her, and a legend by the [Children of the Flame](../World/Organizations/Religions%20&%20Cults/Children%20of%20the%20Flame). [Mae Seraphine Walker](./Mae%20Seraphine%20Walker) is her direct, though distant, descendant.
