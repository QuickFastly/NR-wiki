Himlavård is a colossal mountain range in [[../Map/Ozen|Ozen]] that covers most of the shared borders between [[../Map/Corstaea/Corstaea|Corstaea]], [[../Map/Grenneria/Grenneria|Grenneria]], and [[../Map/Osun Tanum/Osun Tanum|Osun Tanum]], diverging on the border of Osun Tanum and extending both east and west from there. It is flanked by additional, smaller mountain ranges on all three of its ends. In the center of the point where the northern, eastern, and western branches of the range meet are three mountains with the first, third, and fourth highest natural elevations in the world at 8,848, 8,717, and 8,666 meters (29,029, 28,600, and 28,430 feet) respectively.
