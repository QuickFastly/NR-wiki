Nova Regna is the working name for the world that practically all of my stories and characters exist in, because calling it the Keroverse instead would be boring, but officially the world itself has no name. And yes, even though I use the name online and for my music, Kerosyn is a character completely detached from myself. This is a worldbuilding project that I\u2019ve been brewing in my head for longer than the name - but not the character! - Kerosyn has existed, mostly alone with a few great contributions from a couple of friends. I thought it was time to change that, and that\u2019s why this wiki exists. This is an open world , and everything within it - unless explicitly stated otherwise - is licensed under Creative Commons CC BY-SA 4.0 . Anybody can contribute anything to this world, and use anything in it however they want. As it stands now, a huge portion of what\u2019s here is skeletal. There are a lot of broad strokes and rather vague information to give the general idea of most things, not a lot of highly specific detail, some information presented as stories that have yet to be fully parsed, and a lot still brewing in my head yet unwritten. Think of it like the lineart in a coloring book. There\u2019s no limit on the detail that can be added, but it still needs to account for the lines. More detail will always be added naturally over time as stories are written and other content is created inside this world, then we can zoom in deeper and deeper. Personally, I\u2019m focusing mainly on stories first and worldbuilding second now. Oh, also, of course by reading through the things here, there will be plentiful spoilers for various stories that may or may not ever be written, and they will be unmarked. Personally, I don\u2019t think you should care about that, but be aware.","title":"Index"},{"location":"Nova-Regna/CONTRIBUTING/","text":"Guidelines \u00b6 Contributions require approval, but requirements are light and expectations are low. For edits, positive technical changes like fixing typos or grammar, updating links, or adding relevant footnotes will all be approved eventually. Changes to the content itself is subject to the approval of the relevant authors. For new additions, as long as you put in enough effort for others to get the gist of your content, and what you create fits in the world and isn\u2019t awful, it\u2019ll get approved. The world is big, so it\u2019s not hard to fit in it. Some examples of things that wouldn\u2019t fit, however, would be things like new gods, people or technology from another planet, magic that doesn\u2019t follow established rules, or events that contradict established history. Of course, what is currently established could change to suit what you want to add, provided that the changes are also met with the needed approval, so big world-changing ideas are still worth thinking about if you have them and are willing to discuss them. As for what \u201cawful\u201d means, there are two main parts. First would be things that aren\u2019t believable, like a character that never experiences failure or rejection, or has no drawbacks. Second would be anything that can be considered hateful or offensive with no believable in-world reason to exist. Additionally, if what you intend to contribute will directly reference , or be used to actively promote real-world politics, ideologies, religious beliefs, or violence, it will be rejected. This is universal and non-negotiable. Basically, be cool and stay true to the fiction, and you\u2019ll probably be fine. Be sure to also look over the meta notes, as they contain valuable real-world points of comparison for creators, like how to handle foreign language , using mystic matter and attunement , and where to draw and apply real-world influences . Style guide \u00b6 In an attempt to keep this wiki looking somewhat consistent, here are some guidelines on how to actually write stuff. Templates \u00b6 When creating a new page, check if there\u2019s a template available for it, like the Character profile or Organization templates. These give a basic structure that you should try to stick with for the sake of consistency, but feel free to add or remove sections as you need. If there is no existing template, you may still find the Infobox template useful when inserted at the top of a page. Credit \u00b6 When creating a new page, if you want to be credited for it, include the Author info template at the very bottom of the page and edit it to suit you. Use the same info for any other pages you create to keep it consistent. You can also use this block to declare a different license for the content of your page. If you do not include this on your page, you will receive no credit and your page will be licensed with the default CC-BY-SA 4.0. Links \u00b6 When another article is mentioned in any article, or you want to link to an external page somewhere on the internet for any reason, link to it only at the first mention. Unless you have a very specific reason, try not to link to the same thing more than once in the same article. Spelling \u00b6 American English spelling is expected to be used on all canon articles. The only situation where British English spelling should be used instead is in the context of names, items, quotes, and stories originating from or set in areas of the world that would use it. Punctuation \u00b6 Yes, I put this entire subheading here just to tell you to use double quotation marks instead of single, avoid exclamation marks entirely (outside of quoted dialogue) if possible, and use the oxford comma. Voice \u00b6 Something something passive voice bad, third grade English teacher. To be frank, I don\u2019t care whether or not you use the active voice or the passive voice, all I care about is that the information is conveyed. If you want to edit things written in the passive voice into the active voice, I won\u2019t stop you, but I\u2019m also not going to stop anyone else from writing in the passive voice in the first place. Go wild. Tense \u00b6 Everything should be written in the past tense. All articles here are written with the assumption that \u201ccurrent time\u201d is near the end of the year 2033. There is nothing beyond that point, and nothing taking place actively at that time, and that\u2019s by design. Numbers \u00b6 In prose, all numbers less than 11 should be spelled out, and all numbers greater than ten should be shown numerically. Exceptions can include: General, non-exact numbers at and beyond the million (X million/billion/etc) The passage of time (7 minutes, 3 days, etc) Dates, times, and coordinates Dates \u00b6 Dates should be exclusively written numerically in the YYYY/MM/DD format. You may use hyphens as separators as well (YYYY-MM-DD) but the in-world preferred standard is to use slashes. If you want to drop the year, the month must still come first (MM/DD). The week-day format (W##/DD) is also acceptable if you\u2019re into that. This world uses the Gregorian calendar, including leap years, but the months and days in this world do not have names. You can learn more about the specifics of in-world timekeeping here . Pronouns \u00b6 Third-person pronouns should be always be used in all articles unless explicitly referring to the reader, or yourself as the author, both of which you should try to avoid doing outside of meta content anyway. Whenever a character\u2019s gender is uncertain, use the singular \u201cthey\u201d and \u201cthemself\u201d to refer to them. Formality \u00b6 Formal use of language is preferred for most things, but far from mandatory. You should aim to write as formally and impartially as possible, but don\u2019t overthink it if that will hold you back. Just remember that everything written here should be presented as though this world was the real world, and this wiki describes it to its people. Capitalization \u00b6 Both in article titles and inside the articles themselves, unnecessary capitalization should be avoided. Capitalization should be reserved exclusively for proper nouns, the start of sentences, and in-world titles for events and media. For example: \u2026they fought in the Siege of Soukotan. \u2714\ufe0f \u2026they fought in The Siege of Soukotan. \u274c \u2026they fought in the siege of Soukotan. \u274c Italics \u00b6 In-world media and works of art of any kind should always be italicized. The names of historical events, organizations, or other articles should never be italicized. As you can see here, using italics for emphasis is also acceptable, and you should do that rather than using boldface, but ideally your sentences should be explicit enough to not need emphasis at all. Headings \u00b6 Do not use H1 (#) headings at all. Ever. Period. The name of the file is treated as an H1 heading, so the highest heading you should ever use is H2 (##). Headings are automatically parsed into a table of contents, so every heading in a file needs to be H2 or smaller so that they are all correctly nested under the file name. Provided you keep that in mind, you can as few or as many headings as you like. You can nest them as deep as H6 (######) if you want to get really crazy. Admonitions/Callouts \u00b6 Obsidian supports 12 distinct types of admonition (or callout) natively since v0.14.0. They support markdown and wikilinks. For more specific details about them, check the Obsidian documentation . Of the available 12, this wiki will most often use four, which will also be made quickly accessible with Obsidian templates. Info Use this admonition to provide any in-world information you believe readers need to know that isn\u2019t directly relevant enough to be part of the main article. Meta Use this admonition whenever you want to provide real-world information as relevant context for something in an article. Warning Use this admonition to point out things that are important to consider as a creator. For example, when only a handful of characters should know something. Issue Use this admonition to point out where and how something may be incomplete, unfitting, in need editing, or otherwise questionable in any way. You may change the titles of these if you feel another word would fit better for your intended purpose, but please stay consistent to the intended purpose of these colors. For the foldable boxes, you can also replace the plus with a minus to have them be folded by default if you want. Of course, you can still use the other natively supported options if you want to. Here they all are so you can see what they look like and their names and aliases. note example abstract, summary, tldr example info, todo example tip, hint, important example success, check, done example question, help, faq example warning, caution, attention example failure, fail, missing example danger, error example bug example example example quote, cite example How to contribute \u00b6 This entire wiki is written with Obsidian in mind, and readability is focused on Obsidian first. I highly recommend that anyone who wishes to contribute to this wiki use Obsidian to do so. With that said, it is not a requirement and you are free to use whatever method you want to contribute to this wiki. Another thing to keep in mind is that your contributions to this wiki will automatically be licensed under Creative Commons CC BY-SA 4.0 by default, like everything else. You can instead choose to use a different license for your contributions by including it explicitly on your pages, and if you make it easy for others to contact you, you can make separate agreements with individuals as well. For instance, using a non-commercial license publicly, but separately allowing commercial usage only with your explicit permission or under your own terms. I strongly suggest that if you choose to use another license, you use another Creative Commons license. You can try another license if you really want to, but I\u2019ll have to look over it and decide whether or not it aligns with the purpose of this wiki. I am very critical of intellectual property law and want this world to remain fully open, so \u201cAll Rights Reserved\u201d will never be accepted on this wiki. Restrictions may be applied, but all content on this wiki must remain free to use and share to some degree. Now then, on to some of the ways you can contribute. Issues (The easiest option for you) \u00b6 If you would rather not fiddle with git but you still want to contribute something, you can submit an issue without the need for anything more than a GitHub account. Click on the New Issue button at the top right and off you go. Are you suggesting a small edit, correction, or improvement to a page? Paste a link to the page in question (either from the wiki or the repo ), then include the text you want changed, followed by your proposed changes. If you\u2019re suggesting an addition rather than a change, just say so. Are you suggesting the addition of an entirely new page? Write a little bit about what your new page is and why you want to add it, then attach the page as a separate file. It\u2019s strongly preferred to attach .md files with proper Markdown formatting, but .txt .odt .rtf and .docx files are acceptable. If you want to be credited for your work, make sure you use the author info template at the bottom of your page! Once your issue goes through and the proposed changes are accepted, they will be added to the main vault on your behalf, potentially with some changes to the basic formatting for consistency.","title":"CONTRIBUTING"},{"location":"Nova-Regna/CONTRIBUTING/#guidelines","text":"Contributions require approval, but requirements are light and expectations are low.
