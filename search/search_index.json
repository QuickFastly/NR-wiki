Nova Regna is the working name for the world that practically all of my stories and characters exist in, because calling it the Keroverse instead would be boring, but officially the world itself has no name. And yes, even though I use the name online and for my music, Kerosyn is a character completely detached from myself. This is a worldbuilding project that I\u2019ve been brewing in my head for longer than the name - but not the character! - Kerosyn has existed, mostly alone with a few great contributions from a couple of friends. I thought it was time to change that, and that\u2019s why this wiki exists. This is an open world , and everything within it - unless explicitly stated otherwise - is licensed under Creative Commons CC BY-SA 4.0 . Anybody can contribute anything to this world, and use anything in it however they want. If you\u2019re new and just want to browse, I understand that having so many pages and folders visible can be kind of overwhelming, so you can start with Earth and follow the links from there. As it stands now, a huge portion of what\u2019s here is skeletal. Many links don\u2019t work, as they lead to pages that do not exist yet. There are a lot of broad strokes and plenty of rather vague information to give the general idea of most things, and some information is presented as stories that have yet to be fully parsed into informational pieces. Think of it like the lineart in a coloring book. There\u2019s no limit on the detail that can be added, but it still needs to account for the lines. More detail will always be added naturally over time as stories are written and other content is created inside this world, then we can zoom in deeper and deeper. There is, for that matter, a lot of information that simply is not yet written despite being clear in my head. Personally, I\u2019m focusing mainly on stories to fill in the world rather than continuing to expand the wiki on its own now. Oh, also, of course by reading through the things here, there will be plentiful spoilers for various stories that may or may not ever be written, and they will be unmarked. Personally, I don\u2019t think you should care about that, but be aware.","title":"Index"},{"location":"Nova-Regna/CONTRIBUTING/","text":"Guidelines \u00b6 Contributions require approval, but requirements are light and expectations are low. For edits, positive technical changes like fixing typos or grammar, updating links, or adding relevant footnotes will all be approved eventually. Changes to the content itself is subject to the approval of the relevant authors. For new additions, as long as you put in enough effort for others to get the gist of your content, and what you create fits in the world and isn\u2019t awful, it\u2019ll get approved. The world is big, so it\u2019s not hard to fit in it. Some examples of things that wouldn\u2019t fit, however, would be things like new gods, people or technology from another planet, magic that doesn\u2019t follow established rules, or events that contradict established history. Of course, what is currently established could change to suit what you want to add, provided that the changes are also met with the needed approval, so big world-changing ideas are still worth thinking about if you have them and are willing to discuss them. As for what \u201cawful\u201d means, there are two main parts. First would be things that aren\u2019t believable, like a character that never experiences failure or rejection, or has no drawbacks. Second would be anything that can be considered hateful or offensive with no believable in-world reason to exist. Additionally, if what you intend to contribute will directly reference , or be used to actively promote real-world politics, ideologies, religious beliefs, or violence, it will be rejected. This is universal and non-negotiable. Basically, be cool and stay true to the fiction, and you\u2019ll probably be fine. Be sure to also look over the meta notes, as they contain valuable real-world points of comparison for creators, like how to handle foreign language , using mystic matter and attunement , and where to draw and apply real-world influences . Style guide \u00b6 In an attempt to keep this wiki looking somewhat consistent, here are some guidelines on how to actually write stuff. Templates \u00b6 When creating a new page, check if there\u2019s a template available for it, like the Character profile or Organization templates. These give a basic structure that you should try to stick with for the sake of consistency, but feel free to add or remove sections as you need. If there is no existing template, you may still find the Infobox template useful when inserted at the top of a page. (If you\u2019re reading this from the wiki, the missing templates folder is viewable in the repo .) Credit \u00b6 When creating a new page, if you want to be credited for it, include the Author info template at the very bottom of the page and edit it to suit you. Use the same info for any other pages you create to keep it consistent. You can also use this block to declare a different license for the content of your page. If you do not include this on your page, you will receive no credit and your page will be licensed with the default CC-BY-SA 4.0. Links \u00b6 When another article is mentioned in any article, or you want to link to an external page somewhere on the internet for any reason, link to it only at the first mention. Unless you have a very specific reason, try not to link to the same thing more than once in the same article. Spelling \u00b6 American English spelling is expected to be used on all canon articles. The only situation where British English spelling should be used instead is in the context of names, items, quotes, and stories originating from or set in areas of the world that would use it. Punctuation \u00b6 Yes, I put this entire subheading here just to tell you to use double quotation marks instead of single, avoid exclamation marks entirely (outside of quoted dialogue) if possible, and use the oxford comma. Voice \u00b6 Something something passive voice bad, third grade English teacher. To be frank, I don\u2019t care whether or not you use the active voice or the passive voice, all I care about is that the information is conveyed. If you want to edit things written in the passive voice into the active voice, I won\u2019t stop you, but I\u2019m also not going to stop anyone else from writing in the passive voice in the first place. Go wild. Tense \u00b6 Everything should be written in the past tense. All articles here are written with the assumption that \u201ccurrent time\u201d is near the end of the year 2033. There is nothing beyond that point, and nothing taking place actively at that time, and that\u2019s by design. Numbers \u00b6 In prose, all numbers less than 11 should be spelled out, and all numbers greater than ten should be shown numerically. Exceptions can include: General, non-exact numbers at and beyond the million (X million/billion/etc) The passage of time (7 minutes, 3 days, etc) Dates, times, and coordinates Dates \u00b6 Dates should be exclusively written numerically in the YYYY/MM/DD format. You may use hyphens as separators as well (YYYY-MM-DD) but the in-world preferred standard is to use slashes. If you want to drop the year, the month must still come first (MM/DD). The week-day format (W##/DD) is also acceptable if you\u2019re into that. This world uses the Gregorian calendar, including leap years, but the months and days in this world do not have names. You can learn more about the specifics of in-world timekeeping here . Pronouns \u00b6 Third-person pronouns should be always be used in all articles unless explicitly referring to the reader, or yourself as the author, both of which you should try to avoid doing outside of meta content anyway. Whenever a character\u2019s gender is uncertain, use the singular \u201cthey\u201d and \u201cthemself\u201d to refer to them. Formality \u00b6 Formal use of language is preferred for most things, but far from mandatory. You should aim to write as formally and impartially as possible, but don\u2019t overthink it if that will hold you back. Just remember that everything written here should be presented as though this world was the real world, and this wiki describes it to its people. Capitalization \u00b6 Both in article titles and inside the articles themselves, unnecessary capitalization should be avoided. Capitalization should be reserved exclusively for proper nouns, the start of sentences, and in-world titles for events and media. For example: \u2026they fought in the Siege of Soukotan. \u2714\ufe0f \u2026they fought in The Siege of Soukotan. \u274c \u2026they fought in the siege of Soukotan. \u274c Italics \u00b6 In-world media and works of art of any kind should always be italicized. The names of historical events, organizations, or other articles should never be italicized. As you can see here, using italics for emphasis is also acceptable, and you should do that rather than using boldface, but ideally your sentences should be explicit enough to not need emphasis at all. Headings \u00b6 Do not use H1 (#) headings at all. Ever. Period. The name of the file is treated as an H1 heading, so the highest heading you should ever use is H2 (##). Headings are automatically parsed into a table of contents, so every heading in a file needs to be H2 or smaller so that they are all correctly nested under the file name. Provided you keep that in mind, you can as few or as many headings as you like. You can nest them as deep as H6 (######) if you want to get really crazy. Admonitions/Callouts \u00b6 Obsidian supports 12 distinct types of admonition (or callout) natively since v0.14.0. They support markdown and wikilinks. For more specific details about them, check the Obsidian documentation . Of the available 12, this wiki will most often use four, which will also be made quickly accessible with Obsidian templates. Info Use this admonition to provide any in-world information you believe readers need to know that isn\u2019t directly relevant enough to be part of the main article. Meta Use this admonition whenever you want to provide real-world information as relevant context for something in an article. Warning Use this admonition to point out things that are important to consider as a creator. For example, when only a handful of characters should know something. Issue Use this admonition to point out where and how something may be incomplete, unfitting, in need editing, or otherwise questionable in any way. You may change the titles of these if you feel another word would fit better for your intended purpose, but please stay consistent to the intended purpose of these colors. For the foldable boxes, you can also replace the plus with a minus to have them be folded by default if you want. Of course, you can still use the other natively supported options if you want to. Here they all are so you can see what they look like and their names and aliases. note example abstract, summary, tldr example info, todo example tip, hint, important example success, check, done example question, help, faq example warning, caution, attention example failure, fail, missing example danger, error example bug example example example quote, cite example How to contribute \u00b6 This entire wiki is written with Obsidian in mind, and readability is focused on Obsidian first. I highly recommend that anyone who wishes to contribute to this wiki use Obsidian to do so. With that said, it is not a requirement and you are free to use whatever method you want to contribute to this wiki. Another thing to keep in mind is that your contributions to this wiki will automatically be licensed under Creative Commons CC BY-SA 4.0 by default, like everything else. You can instead choose to use a different license for your contributions by including it explicitly on your pages, and if you make it easy for others to contact you, you can make separate agreements with individuals as well. For instance, using a non-commercial license publicly, but separately allowing commercial usage only with your explicit permission or under your own terms. I strongly suggest that if you choose to use another license, you use another Creative Commons license. You can try another license if you really want to, but I\u2019ll have to look over it and decide whether or not it aligns with the purpose of this wiki. I am very critical of intellectual property law and want this world to remain fully open, so \u201cAll Rights Reserved\u201d will never be accepted on this wiki. Restrictions may be applied, but all content on this wiki must remain free to use and share to some degree. Now then, on to some of the ways you can contribute. Issues \u00b6 If you would rather not fiddle with git but you still want to contribute something, you can submit an issue without the need for anything more than a GitHub account. Click on the New Issue button at the top right and off you go. If you aren\u2019t familiar with git, this will be the easiest for you. Are you suggesting a small edit, correction, or improvement to a page? Paste a link to the page in question (either from the wiki or the repo ), then include the text you want changed, followed by your proposed changes. If you\u2019re suggesting an addition rather than a change, just say so. Are you suggesting the addition of an entirely new page? Write a little bit about what your new page is and why you want to add it, then attach the page as a separate file. It\u2019s strongly preferred to attach .md files with Obsidian Markdown formatting, but .txt , .odt , .rtf , and .docx files are acceptable. If you want to be credited for your work, make sure you use the author info template at the bottom of your page! If you don\u2019t have a Markdown editor and don\u2019t want to download anything, you have options . If you have Obsidian and you download this vault (click Code, then Download ZIP), you can create new pages that way and simply upload the finished .md file with your issue. Once your issue goes through and the proposed changes are accepted, they will be added to the main vault on your behalf, potentially with some changes to the basic formatting for consistency. Pull requests \u00b6 If you are relatively familiar with git, this route will be preferable to submitting an issue because rather than submitting a proposal for edits or attaching an extra file, you can just make the edits directly to the files or add a new file directly to the collection yourself and submit them for approval, and you can submit several things at once. Since this whole project is just words instead of code, though, this shouldn\u2019t be too difficult even if you aren\u2019t familiar with git. At the top right of the repo (in the Code tab), click on the Fork button to create your own copy of the repo under your GitHub account. If you don\u2019t want to download anything or you don\u2019t know what cloning a repo means, you can actually edit files and upload new ones to your forked repo from right here in the browser. For edits, just find the .md file you want to edit and click on it, then click on the small pencil button on the top right corner of the container with all the text in it. It\u2019ll be on the same line as the button that says \u201cRaw\u201d. To add a new page, navigate into the folder where your new page belongs, click on the Add file button in the top right, and you can either create a new file from scratch or upload a file you already wrote. In both cases, from there, you can edit the file and preview it, and when you\u2019re done, just enter a summary of your edits in the Commit Changes area, then hit the green button. After making changes, you should see a new button on your forked repo to create a new pull request, or in other words, submit your changes for review. Be aware that the more changes you make for your pull request, the more difficult it might be to accept! If your pull request has some accepted changes and some rejected ones, it will be closed without merging, then I will work with you to get the accepted changes in anyway. You should also remember to synchronize your fork before getting to work on any changes, because there may have been other changes already merged into the main branch that you don\u2019t have yet! If ever you see the sync fork button near the top right corner, click on it. Have a look at the GitHub documentation if you want to learn more about git , forks , and pull requests . If you take the time to learn the basics of this stuff, you can download your fork to your computer locally and use any program you want to write with, and you can do all of this without even opening your browser if you\u2019re so inclined. Of course, if you know what cloning is and how to do it, you don\u2019t need me to tell you that. Obsidian git \u00b6 If you\u2019re an Obsidian user, you can use the Obsidian git plugin for this. This is the method I recommend, because the vault looks best in Obsidian, was made in Obsidian, and is most convenient to work with through Obsidian. First, fork the repo as decribed earlier, then (assuming you\u2019re a Windows user who doesn\u2019t like the command line) follow this guide with one major difference. That guide tells you to start with a new, empty repo, but for our purposes your repo will already have a vault in it, so you can skip the whole \u201cmaking your vault a repository\u201d step. GitHub Desktop has a Mac version too, and even a Linux version sometimes for some reason, but you\u2019re on your own there. In the Obsidian git plugin settings, I recommend enabling pull updates on startup, push on backup, and pull changes before push. You will still (to my knowledge) have to manually sync your fork with the main repo every now and then, but with these settings, you can sync your fork and then open Obsidian and it will automatically be up to date as well. I also would recommend leaving automatic backups turned off, and instead do it manually for every file you change by pressing ctrl+P, searching for \u201cbackup\u201d, and choosing \u201ccreate backup with specific message\u201d so you can be descriptive about what changed instead of having 500 of the same commit message. But ultimately, it\u2019s in your hands, not mine. I will admit, setting this up for the first time did not go smoothly for me, but it\u2019s been long enough that I don\u2019t remember what my problem was. What I do know for sure, however, is that it wasn\u2019t the fault of the plugin, it was something to do with my git setup being wrong. Your mileage may vary, look through the plugin issues and use Google if you have trouble. It\u2019s also entirely possible to use Obsidian and simply upload your changes through the browser as described in the pull requests section without using the git plugin, but it\u2019s less cool.","title":"CONTRIBUTING"},{"location":"Nova-Regna/CONTRIBUTING/#guidelines","text":"Contributions require approval, but requirements are light and expectations are low.

It\u2019ll be on the same line as the button that says \u201cRaw\u201d. To add a new page, navigate into the folder where your new page belongs, click on the Add file button in the top right, and you can either create a new file from scratch or upload a file you already wrote. In both cases, from there, you can edit the file and preview it, and when you\u2019re done, just enter a summary of your edits in the Commit Changes area, then hit the green button. After making changes, you should see a new button on your forked repo to create a new pull request, or in other words, submit your changes for review. Be aware that the more changes you make for your pull request, the more difficult it might be to accept! If your pull request has some accepted changes and some rejected ones, it will be closed without merging, then I will work with you to get the accepted changes in anyway. You should also remember to synchronize your fork before getting to work on any changes, because there may have been other changes already merged into the main branch that you don\u2019t have yet! If ever you see the sync fork button near the top right corner, click on it. Have a look at the GitHub documentation if you want to learn more about git , forks , and pull requests . If you take the time to learn the basics of this stuff, you can download your fork to your computer locally and use any program you want to write with, and you can do all of this without even opening your browser if you\u2019re so inclined. Of course, if you know what cloning is and how to do it, you don\u2019t need me to tell you that.","title":"Pull requests"},{"location":"Nova-Regna/CONTRIBUTING/#obsidian-git","text":"If you\u2019re an Obsidian user, you can use the Obsidian git plugin for this. This is the method I recommend, because the vault looks best in Obsidian, was made in Obsidian, and is most convenient to work with through Obsidian. First, fork the repo as decribed earlier, then (assuming you\u2019re a Windows user who doesn\u2019t like the command line) follow this guide with one major difference. That guide tells you to start with a new, empty repo, but for our purposes your repo will already have a vault in it, so you can skip the whole \u201cmaking your vault a repository\u201d step. GitHub Desktop has a Mac version too, and even a Linux version sometimes for some reason, but you\u2019re on your own there. In the Obsidian git plugin settings, I recommend enabling pull updates on startup, push on backup, and pull changes before push. You will still (to my knowledge) have to manually sync your fork with the main repo every now and then, but with these settings, you can sync your fork and then open Obsidian and it will automatically be up to date as well. I also would recommend leaving automatic backups turned off, and instead do it manually for every file you change by pressing ctrl+P, searching for \u201cbackup\u201d, and choosing \u201ccreate backup with specific message\u201d so you can be descriptive about what changed instead of having 500 of the same commit message. But ultimately, it\u2019s in your hands, not mine. I will admit, setting this up for the first time did not go smoothly for me, but it\u2019s been long enough that I don\u2019t remember what my problem was. What I do know for sure, however, is that it wasn\u2019t the fault of the plugin, it was something to do with my git setup being wrong. Your mileage may vary, look through the plugin issues and use Google if you have trouble. It\u2019s also entirely possible to use Obsidian and simply upload your changes through the browser as described in the pull requests section without using the git plugin, but it\u2019s less cool.","title":"Obsidian git"},{"location":"Nova-Regna/USAGE-GUIDELINES/","text":"There are virtually zero restrictions on how you use almost anything in this world, you have total creative freedom with your own creations provided you abide by the appropriate license(s).

Meta This character is something of a fourth wall breaker, because it\u2019s also the character Kit uses for his real-world streams. It started as a joke and got out of hand, now it\u2019s here. The character on this page is not Kit, however, and will be treated completely separately should they ever be included in a story as more than a joke reference. Warning The existence of K-17 T0 is considered top secret and effectively unknown to the world. The public believes that K-17 T0 is fictional due to their activity as a virtual idol, and K-17 T0 never leaves the secure floors of Hijiya Tower. The prototype android model K-17 T0 is the culmination of a 12 year project started in 2008 by the now defunct Hijiya Corporation AI Innovation division. It is a humanoid robot constructed primarily of surplus parts from the security division of the robotics branch. It stands at just below the average height of women in Shinzen, but weighs as much as four average men, though the production version was slated to come in a variety of human shapes and sizes with accurately proportional weights. The purpose of the project was to develop an AI program with advanced learning capability and the capacity to pass as human in specific situations, but the program exceeded expectations. The AI\u2019s capacity to learn was far higher than projected and in 2018, it was deemed sentient by the company. The next two years of development were spent interacting with the prototype and allowing it to learn as much as it could about being alive in a human world. The program was halted in 2020, not because development was complete, but because the AI innovation division was shuttered to avoid bankruptcy. However, by this time, the prototype had already learned so much that it could hold interesting conversations and had even begun to show signs of a unique personality developing. This raised a serious ethical dilemma, because the executives had ordered for the entire division to be completely deactivated, but that would mean depriving a sentient being of its life. Ultimately the choice was made to allow the prototype to continue operating within certain areas of the building, and it was given free reign over them. Over time, as the prototype continued to interact with people and develop more personality and humanity, many employees began to find a genuine friend in it. They nicknamed it \u201cKitto\u201d or \u201cKit\u201d after its model number, and some began to refer to it as \u201che\u201d or \u201cshe\u201d from time to time. The prototype expressed discomfort towards being referred to with human gendered pronouns though, which in itself was considered a breakthrough in the AI\u2019s development. By 2021, it had become virtually indistinguishable from a human, and had developed a full, unique personality of its own, with its own tastes, preferences, and desires, with a particular interest in video games. Its existence was also still unknown to the world. When the prototype asked about the internet, it was decided to allow it access to the internet through a standard computer, but nobody foresaw that it would broadcast its own existence through a livestream. Fortunately for the company, there was a widespread trend of people livestreaming using virtual avatars, and everyone believed that was what the prototype was, including a virtual idol group that reached out intending to hire the prototype. The company stepped in and allowed the prototype to sign on with the virtual idol group under the condition that they sign a strict secondary agreement, so any public statements regarding the prototype as a member of their group must first be approved by the company, and the group\u2019s communication with the prototype must be limited.

His real name is not known, nor his origins or even appearance. The only part of his body that is ever visible is his hair. His true age is also not known, only that he is over 473, since he became Storyteller in the year 1560. Being effectively nameless, he allows others to call him by the name \u201cSix\u201d outside of formal or official settings. Physical description \u00b6 Due to the fact that the only part of his body ever seen is his hair, and that he is always seen wearing heavy clothing no matter the weather or temperature, the only description of his appearance that can be given is that he has very long and wiry brown hair, is slightly above average height for a human, and appears to be of an average build. He is severely underweight, but that is hidden well by his clothing. While he does not display any obvious signs of being a spirit and appears to be relatively average size for a human, nobody knows for certain whether or not he truly is human. He wears a black cap with his hair threaded through its back, a black neck gaiter, extremely oversized mirror glasses, black formal gloves, a thick gray long sleeved shirt, a heavy green jacket with a high collar, heavy blue jeans, and gray slip-on shoes. He uses a black wooden cane with a carved handle to walk. Special abilities \u00b6 Six is Deathless , and is the reason that anyone in the general public is aware of such a concept. He has said that death is not natural, it is a curse, and that for an incredible cost, the curse can be broken. Nobody knows how he became deathless, or what his \u201cincredible cost\u201d was, however. His existence is of great interest to governments and scientists around the world, but his power within the Children of the Flame allows him to keep their meddling at bay, keeping his secret safe. Personality \u00b6 Six is very quiet, calm, and restrained. He rarely speaks in anything other than sparse, short sentences, but when he does speak in more depth, he is highly eloquent. His voice gives away little to no emotion, but his words often express compassion and concern. His body language also shows little to no emotion at any given time, instead being rather unsettling due to the fact that he moves so little that he appears motionless much of the time. Beyond the empty outward appearance, he has shown two main traits. An insatiable thirst for knowledge, and a deep concern for the future of humanity. Relationships \u00b6 The only people close to him are Leon Van Wolfe , his advisor, and Mae Seraphine Walker , his right hand. He places great trust in them and allows them to know more about himself and his knowledge than anyone else, but still hides much from them. They are the only ones to have seen any of his body, for instance, but even they don\u2019t know where he was born, how old he truly is, or if he is even human. He is also acquainted with Kerosyn , Freya , and Florian . He regularly makes contact with them to keep them informed about the state of the organization and his plans, but despite the fact that they are gods to him, he respects the wishes of Kerosyn and Freya to be treated as equals and to keep them out of the spotlight. With Florian, however, he is in frequent contact as they assist each other with their research. History \u00b6 He wrote The Account over 200 years ago. When he became Storyteller in 1560, a huge number of ranking individuals across all four branches of the Children of the Flame disappeared overnight, seemingly without a trace. He has never spoken of this event, but in recent times after deeper study of historical records, some theorize that Six had actually usurped control of the faith and disposed of those who opposed somehow. He has never responded to this theory, nor have any of those studying the history been met with any kind of resistance.

She currently lives in rural Shiga in Onsai , Shinzen . Physical description \u00b6 She has deep silver eyes, brilliant white hair and fur, very large silky smooth fox ears and tail, digitigrade feet, retractable claw-like fingernails, leather bracers and greaves with steel plates, and a short floral kimono. More detail TBD She suffers from severe pulmonary hypoplasia , leaving her constantly short of breath, prone to coughing fits, and physically weakened with extremely little stamina. Since (year), she has needed prosthetic legs starting just below the knees. Special abilities \u00b6 Like all fox spirits, she has both Alignment and Attunement . Despite spending all of her early life being trained in the traditional sword arts of the Inazuma, she never mastered them due to her physical weakness and lack of stamina. Instead, she developed her own unique variation of Inazuma swordsmanship with the help of Shun that focuses primarily on the command of lightning rather than the blade itself.

Looks like he couldn\u2019t hurt a fly. Body Features \u00b6 Pale skinned Very tall, particularly straight whitetail antlers. Has deer ears. Facial Features \u00b6 Brown hair, long and straight with various braids Wears black war paint over his eyes and on his chin. Very round, large eyes that suck you in. Eyes are brown, with horizontal pupils and extremely pronounced cataracts Identifying Characteristics \u00b6 Adorns his antlers with various flowers and vines according to the season. Apparel & Accessories \u00b6 Dark green 3/4 length high collar womens peacoat Fancy brown tunic with gold trim Light tan ankle banded pants Brown leather boots Ornate staff covered in runes made from a tree branch Issue The whole physical description heading is old info that I won\u2019t be bothering to update until I get a visual representation of him, which may look quite different. At that point, this section of the page will be updated with proper formatting based on that. Special abilities \u00b6 His alignment grants him what is effectively 360 degree vision and the ability to see around corners. Though, being blind from birth, he does not see anything the same as a sighted person would. Vision through alignment also allows him to see unimpeded in darkness, and with his eyes closed or covered. His attunement primarily manifests as near total dominion over flora and fauna, allowing him to control, manipulate, and weaponize any and all living things - excluding humans and spirits - within a radius of at least 20 kilometers. Within visual range, he can also manipulate and weaponize air, water, and the earth, appearing to use his staff as a focus of sorts. Both of these things also grant him a certain closeness with the natural world. He cannot converse with animals or read their thoughts, and he cannot speak to plants, but he experiences an intuitive sense of their conditions, which allows him a level of understanding and compassion towards nature that very few others can achieve. As an incarnation, his attunement also gives him drastically increased physical durability and resistance, allowing him to survive without food or water for long periods of time, resist diseases and poisons, and bear extreme heat or cold without issue. Personality \u00b6 Dvalinn is a stoic, cold, mysterious type of guy, seemingly unconcerned with the people of the world, and he radiates an aura of serenity and elegance. At least, that\u2019s what he wants you to think. In truth, Dvalinn is a very timid person with social difficulties thanks to having spent most of his life isolated deep in the woods. He is very uptight, has an inflated sense of self-importance, and delusions of grandeur, but lacks the social experience to assert himself, so he is very easily flustered and is surprisingly delicate, especially around women, even more so when they are taller than he is. The one area where he exhibits full confidence is on the topic of nature. Being part of the fringe faction of deer spirits, his reverence for nature and desire to see it protected is a core part of him, and he will not hesitate to silence anyone he sees as an enemy to nature, be it with words, or through terror. Motivation \u00b6 Dvalinn is concerned primarily with the preservation of undisturbed forests around the world, with the safety and prosperity of deer spirits being a distant second. He is an odd mixture of conflicting extremes, preferring to avoid violence entirely at all times while still being willing to inflict extreme and vicious violence on the enemy. On his own, when he encounters people wandering into his forest or camping, he will peacefully guide them out and instruct them to stay out, be it kindly or frightfully. But when loggers, city planners, developers, builders, hunters, poachers, or anything similar find their way into his forest, they are never heard from again. With enough convincing, Freya took advantage of his violent heart to sway him to join the Risky Witches with the promise that by protecting deer spirits with the group, they will go on to protect the forests themselves. While he still does what he can to protect forests personally, he now finds pleasure in combat. Relationships \u00b6 Dvalinn was the most difficult of the incarnations for Freya to recruit due to having no particular attachment to the outside world or the people in it, and he remains the most distant from her in the group, mostly treating her as a superior rather than a friend. He has a rather sour relationship with Garm because of her constant bullying and pestering, but still tries to treat her with respect. He views Kuhai as little more than a colleague and mostly treats her as such. He enjoys speaking with Neven when she\u2019s alone, but finds her annoying when others are around. He is closest with Haida and deeply values her wisdom, showing her the most respect in the group. In truth, he is quite bad at hiding his true feelings, especially when teased about them. While it\u2019s true that he was distant at first, over time he did grow very close with everyone in the group and would do a lot for them, but he will never admit that to anyone. Affiliations \u00b6 He is a member of the Risky Witches Task Force 5555 with the effective rank of O-6. History \u00b6 sorry nothing Trivia \u00b6 Being so uptight, trying so hard to act mysterious and noble, being the only man among the incarnations, there are plenty of fitting reasons for his \u201cPrincess\u201d nickname. As for its real origin, it came from Freya teasing him about the flowers on his antlers. Being blind from birth, yet still able to see thanks to his alignment, Dvalinn has a strange relationship with color. He knows what basic colors are, and what colors many things are meant to be, but does not actually know what color looks like to a sighted person.

He is one of the three deities of the Children of the Flame , along with Freya and Kerosyn . Physical description \u00b6 Florian is an extremely tall, pale skinned man with a very lanky build. His arms and legs are almost too long for the rest of his body, giving him an almost unnatural look. His wide, piercing eyes are bright yellow, and have a black sclera. The upper portion of his face is covered by a large and severe burn scar, and the skin is almost entirely missing, but only his forehead and ears are bandaged. He also has pointed and jagged teeth. His arms are covered in iridescent black feathers, and his fingers are also primarily feathers, though they can still grab and hold things without issue. These feathers are also capable of hardening and sharpening at will, allowing him to use his fingers as incredibly sharp knives. An inky black smoke pours off his arms at all times and rises from his sleeves and collar. He seems to be capable of altering the rate of this process along with the consistency of the smoke, but cannot stop it. The Brand is burned into his chest in white, glowing so faintly that it\u2019s only noticeable in the dark, making it quite difficult to see against his colorless skin. His skin is cold to the touch, rough, and incredibly thick and durable. His whole abdomen is wrapped in bandages, except for the area displaying the Brand, and aside from himself, Freya, and Kerosyn, nobody knows what\u2019s under them, only that he\u2019s always bleeding. He apparently changes them frequently though, as he is only rarely seen with bloodied bandages. Despite what his slim frame may suggest, Florian is actually extremely heavy. His weight comes from having supernaturally dense skin, muscles, and bones, along with having a significantly higher mass of blood in his veins than their total available volume should be capable of containing. Clothing \u00b6 Florian wears a tattered black cassock with an open front, dark red stains on the bottom, and the Brand emblazoned on the back in red, along with a black clergy shirt with an open front and no collar, black trousers with a red belt, black high-heeled boots, a black flat top hat with a very wide brim and a red band, and a pellegrina made of black feathers with red fasteners. He claims to own other clothes, but nobody can tell if that\u2019s true since he always seems to be wearing the exact same thing. Particularly observant individuals have claimed that sometimes he has worn boots with slightly more or less heel, a cassock with slightly different stains, or even slightly fancier trousers, leading some to believe that he simply owns a whole wardrobe of identical outfits. Of course, he is extremely reluctant to even entertain the thought of trying something new, and isn\u2019t even willing to remove his hat most of the time. Special abilities \u00b6 He wields Attunement to its fullest potential, able to do quite literally anything short of a feat of creation on his own, but when he, Kerosyn, and Freya work together, they become seemingly omnipotent, capable of reality-altering feats of unknown magnitude. The three of them also seem to share some type of telepathic link, which allows them to always know each other\u2019s location and to share strong feelings, but does not allow them to communicate directly. Finally, his Alignment gives him the ability to directly perceive the current health of all living things, as well as psychometry and the ability to immediately understand what a living thing is feeling on a primitive level through physical contact. Interestingly, that\u2019s all it gives him, as he experiences no other effects of the condition and cannot directly perceive Mystic Matter itself. The obvious manifestation of his power is the inky black smoke pouring off of him, but that\u2019s only the visible result. That smoke is actually caused by his blood boiling in the veins of his arms. His body produces such an incredible amount of blood that it becomes thick and very dark, and the pressure rises to such extreme levels that boiling occurs. To control the flow of that smoke, he actually changes the flow rate of his own blood, which is his signature use of power, blood manipulation. Should he wish to, he could slow or stop the flow of blood in another being with a slight gesture, control a body like a marionette by pushing and pulling on its blood, make himself look larger and scarier by drawing out his own blood and shaping it into things like giant wings, and so on. He can also use the smoke from his arms to influence the health of other living things by allowing it to be inhaled, or by allowing his blood to be consumed. He draws his own blood out primarily from underneath the bandages on his abdomen. As an entirely immortal being, he cannot die. His body is frighteningly, unnaturally durable, but he is not completely invulnerable. Should one somehow manage to injure him, they will find that his blood explodes out of him at an extremely high pressure and temperature, only to stop after the wound closes mere seconds later. Lost body parts can be reattached in seconds or grown back over varying periods of time, and it\u2019s seemingly impossible to decapitate him. An interesting side effect of his blood being so hot is that his core body temperature is just below the boiling point, but the incredible thickness of his skin keeps all that heat contained and leaves his body cold to the touch, so cutting him will most often do more lasting damage to his attacker than it will to him. Personality \u00b6 Florian is a highly eccentric and passionate man with an immense ego and the attitude of a fanatical preacher from ages past. This is largely a result of his total devotion to his ambition leaving him isolated and disconnected from the wider world for most of his life, which has also seriously stunted his social skills and ability to understand or empathize with others, and left him extremely reluctant to accept help from anyone with anything. He carries himself with a strict, antiquated type of grace that would have seemed a bit pompous even several centuries ago. Despite that, he also has a number of strange quirks in his behavior, like constantly muttering to himself (or animals\u2026 or plants\u2026 or even books), using extremely exaggerated hand movements when speaking, frequent fidgeting with his hands and eyes, having a less-than-sane looking grin, and an unfortunately devilish laugh. He takes himself far too seriously, and is very quick to turn zealous in discussions he has an vested interest in. He maintains a quietly restrained voice most of the time, but when he feels the need to speak up, he can get very loud and will talk over others. Especially in arguments, which he tends to see only two sides in, and often ends up starting one way or another. He is very unapproachable and difficult to get along with, but he doesn\u2019t mind that. For the few who do manage to approach him though, he is also quite susceptible to being manipulated through flattery and praise. However, beneath the scary face, that bravado is only an act, one that he\u2019s only capable of maintaining around people he isn\u2019t close to that aren\u2019t confident enough to stand up to him. Beneath the act, he is actually a quiet, meek, deeply compassionate person who wants nothing more than the best for the world and those living in it, despite his difficulties with empathy and understanding. He cares deeply enough for living things that he will go out of his way to spare the life of the smallest insect and the frailest flower, and will always treat people as innocent until proven guilty. Part of what drives his compassionate side is a looming sense of guilt, because Florian believes that he is responsible for the existence of the concept of death. He considers the death of every person a failure on his part to save them. Because of this, he goes very far out of his way to be close to the dying to do everything he can to ease their suffering, as well as to attend funerals and wakes to offer condolences and comfort to the friends and families of the dead. He has otherwise fully devoted his life to studying mystic matter, biology, and the medical field with the ultimate goal of ending death forever. He works alongside the Children of the Flame frequently to further his research, and whenever their goals are otherwise aligned. He has little interest in anything else. Split personality \u00b6 Florian struggles with a split personality that troubles him greatly. On occasion, in moments of extreme stress, anger, or frustration, he becomes someone who goes against all of his ideals. He becomes loud, aggressive, and hateful, with an especially vocal resentment of humanity. He may slam doors, hit tables and walls, and throw things, but can usually stop just short of causing harm to another person. Unfortunately, if there was enough stress or anger beforehand, he can become violent enough to be a threat to the lives of those around him. These flare-ups are uncommon and short-lived, but a deep and long lasting depression follows when he comes back to his senses. Exactly what causes this is unclear, but Florian claims to know exactly what it is, though all he has ever shared about it is that it\u2019s not psychological. Kerosyn and Freya also claim to know, but have never spoken about it. Fighting style \u00b6 Florian is not a fighter at all and instead relies on cheap tricks to gain the advantage. He strongly prefers to avoid violence in the first place, and will always choose to either diffuse the situation or flee the scene if he does not believe his opponent deserves to die. But if he does believe that, he will look for the perfect opportunity to land a killing blow, no matter how dirty it may be, often allowing the opponent to hit him first so he can shrug it off and impale them with his arm. Despite his distaste for violence, he revels in the deaths of his enemies. Relationships \u00b6 Having spent close to their entire lives together, Kerosyn, Freya, and Florian are family in all but blood relation. Florian is the middle child of the three. Florian sees Kerosyn as an annoying younger sibling. He finds them to be quite irritating, but cherishes them nonetheless and tries to be there for them. He is happy to teach Kerosyn whatever they want to learn from him, but Kerosyn\u2019s short attention span makes it difficult and sometimes leads to fights. The fights tend to be short lived, and despite Kerosyn\u2019s obliviousness, they tend to be first to apologize, and Florian is quick to forgive them. Usually. He sees Freya as a sister, but they treat each other more like workplace colleagues most of the time due to their very different personalities and interests. While they may not be outwardly close, he will still defend Freya from anything. In theory. In reality, she\u2019s the one who stands up for him, because he can\u2019t come close to matching her absurd levels of confidence. Of course, she also enjoys picking on him frequently because of that, much to his chagrin, but he\u2019ll always laugh about it later. The relationship between these three can sometimes appear more parental than that of siblings due to Kerosyn\u2019s childlike nature, though they all vehemently reject the idea of that. Despite being in regular contact with The Sixth Storyteller , and often in close proximity as well, Florian calls him an ally, but not a friend. They work together on many things, but Florian feels that there\u2019s something off about him and ignores his attempts to be friendly. Proximity to the Storyteller also means being close to Leon Van Wolfe and Mae Seraphine Walker , both of whom Florian is on much friendlier terms with. Affiliations \u00b6 Being one of the three deities of the Children of the Flame, Florian is very strongly affiliated with them. He revels in the ego boost of being worshiped, so he frequently works closely with the organization and even reveals himself to the regular members freely. He is in frequent direct contact with The Sixth Storyteller. History \u00b6 Some of Florian\u2019s history during Era Dira is described in The Account . Trivia \u00b6 Florian actually has quite poor vision and hearing even by regular human standards, but his sense of smell is impossibly sharp. Florian has an eidetic memory. He\u2019ll still find a way to forget faces anyway, but he never forgets something he sees that has value to him, even if only a glimpse. He could safely perform open heart surgery with his eyes closed because of this. Florian doesn\u2019t need to eat or drink to survive, and for that matter has trouble keeping food down. But he does still require sleep. He can, however, survive on much less sleep than a human. Florian has a stutter and an eye tic, both of which get worse with stress. Thanks to Kerosyn and Freya, despite his resistance, Florian is a skilled musician. However, while those two can play pretty much anything they want well, Florian can \u201conly\u201d play instruments in the violin and keyboard families. He claims to have no favorite.

His arms and legs are almost too long for the rest of his body, giving him an almost unnatural look. His wide, piercing eyes are bright yellow, and have a black sclera. The upper portion of his face is covered by a large and severe burn scar, and the skin is almost entirely missing, but only his forehead and ears are bandaged. He also has pointed and jagged teeth. His arms are covered in iridescent black feathers, and his fingers are also primarily feathers, though they can still grab and hold things without issue. These feathers are also capable of hardening and sharpening at will, allowing him to use his fingers as incredibly sharp knives. An inky black smoke pours off his arms at all times and rises from his sleeves and collar. He seems to be capable of altering the rate of this process along with the consistency of the smoke, but cannot stop it. The Brand is burned into his chest in white, glowing so faintly that it\u2019s only noticeable in the dark, making it quite difficult to see against his colorless skin. His skin is cold to the touch, rough, and incredibly thick and durable. His whole abdomen is wrapped in bandages, except for the area displaying the Brand, and aside from himself, Freya, and Kerosyn, nobody knows what\u2019s under them, only that he\u2019s always bleeding. He apparently changes them frequently though, as he is only rarely seen with bloodied bandages. Despite what his slim frame may suggest, Florian is actually extremely heavy. His weight comes from having supernaturally dense skin, muscles, and bones, along with having a significantly higher mass of blood in his veins than their total available volume should be capable of containing.","title":"Physical description"},{"location":"Nova-Regna/Characters/Incarnations%20%26%20Gods/Florian/#clothing","text":"Florian wears a tattered black cassock with an open front, dark red stains on the bottom, and the Brand emblazoned on the back in red, along with a black clergy shirt with an open front and no collar, black trousers with a red belt, black high-heeled boots, a black flat top hat with a very wide brim and a red band, and a pellegrina made of black feathers with red fasteners. He claims to own other clothes, but nobody can tell if that\u2019s true since he always seems to be wearing the exact same thing. Particularly observant individuals have claimed that sometimes he has worn boots with slightly more or less heel, a cassock with slightly different stains, or even slightly fancier trousers, leading some to believe that he simply owns a whole wardrobe of identical outfits. Of course, he is extremely reluctant to even entertain the thought of trying something new, and isn\u2019t even willing to remove his hat most of the time.","title":"Clothing"},{"location":"Nova-Regna/Characters/Incarnations%20%26%20Gods/Florian/#special-abilities","text":"He wields Attunement to its fullest potential, able to do quite literally anything short of a feat of creation on his own, but when he, Kerosyn, and Freya work together, they become seemingly omnipotent, capable of reality-altering feats of unknown magnitude. The three of them also seem to share some type of telepathic link, which allows them to always know each other\u2019s location and to share strong feelings, but does not allow them to communicate directly. Finally, his Alignment gives him the ability to directly perceive the current health of all living things, as well as psychometry and the ability to immediately understand what a living thing is feeling on a primitive level through physical contact. Interestingly, that\u2019s all it gives him, as he experiences no other effects of the condition and cannot directly perceive Mystic Matter itself. The obvious manifestation of his power is the inky black smoke pouring off of him, but that\u2019s only the visible result. That smoke is actually caused by his blood boiling in the veins of his arms. His body produces such an incredible amount of blood that it becomes thick and very dark, and the pressure rises to such extreme levels that boiling occurs. To control the flow of that smoke, he actually changes the flow rate of his own blood, which is his signature use of power, blood manipulation. Should he wish to, he could slow or stop the flow of blood in another being with a slight gesture, control a body like a marionette by pushing and pulling on its blood, make himself look larger and scarier by drawing out his own blood and shaping it into things like giant wings, and so on. He can also use the smoke from his arms to influence the health of other living things by allowing it to be inhaled, or by allowing his blood to be consumed. He draws his own blood out primarily from underneath the bandages on his abdomen. As an entirely immortal being, he cannot die. His body is frighteningly, unnaturally durable, but he is not completely invulnerable. Should one somehow manage to injure him, they will find that his blood explodes out of him at an extremely high pressure and temperature, only to stop after the wound closes mere seconds later. Lost body parts can be reattached in seconds or grown back over varying periods of time, and it\u2019s seemingly impossible to decapitate him. An interesting side effect of his blood being so hot is that his core body temperature is just below the boiling point, but the incredible thickness of his skin keeps all that heat contained and leaves his body cold to the touch, so cutting him will most often do more lasting damage to his attacker than it will to him.","title":"Special abilities"},{"location":"Nova-Regna/Characters/Incarnations%20%26%20Gods/Florian/#personality","text":"Florian is a highly eccentric and passionate man with an immense ego and the attitude of a fanatical preacher from ages past. This is largely a result of his total devotion to his ambition leaving him isolated and disconnected from the wider world for most of his life, which has also seriously stunted his social skills and ability to understand or empathize with others, and left him extremely reluctant to accept help from anyone with anything. He carries himself with a strict, antiquated type of grace that would have seemed a bit pompous even several centuries ago. Despite that, he also has a number of strange quirks in his behavior, like constantly muttering to himself (or animals\u2026 or plants\u2026 or even books), using extremely exaggerated hand movements when speaking, frequent fidgeting with his hands and eyes, having a less-than-sane looking grin, and an unfortunately devilish laugh. He takes himself far too seriously, and is very quick to turn zealous in discussions he has an vested interest in. He maintains a quietly restrained voice most of the time, but when he feels the need to speak up, he can get very loud and will talk over others. Especially in arguments, which he tends to see only two sides in, and often ends up starting one way or another.

She is one of the three deities of the Children of the Flame , along with Florian and Kerosyn . She is also the leader of the Risky Witches and was responsible for The Big Event . Physical description \u00b6 Freya is a very tall, caramel skinned woman with an athletic, pear shaped build. She has sharp, narrow, bright yellow eyes with vertical pupils that have a subtle glow, with wrinkles and dark rings underneath. She also has sharp pointed teeth, long and subtly pointed fingernails capable of extending and morphing into cat claws, and two long black cat tails with white tips, matching her short and messy hair. The Brand is burned into her back in white with a red outline. It glows just bright enough to shine through one layer of clothing in daylight, and it stands out strongly in the dark unless covered. Four blue flame wisps float around her, but are rarely seen. They don\u2019t appear on any camera or in any mirror, and they only become faintly visible to the naked eye when she allows them to, or is too focused on something else to continue hiding them. Some people with Alignment can see them more clearly and in more circumstances though. Clothing \u00b6 Freya\u2019s favorite outfit consists of a cropped tank top with thick black and white stripes, a red leather jacket, black fingerless riding gloves, black leather biker pants, and black and white leather boots with red laces. She will often wear the jacket around her waist or take it off entirely to suit the circumstances. She also wears and ancient fire-damaged brass pendant that displays a cherry blossom, held on a red leather necklace. This pendant is one of a matching pair, the other belonging to Kerosyn. When not wearing that outfit, she strongly prefers flashy masculine clothing, tends to lean towards dark colors plus black and white, has a penchant for stripes, and prefers tops with either no sleeves or very short ones, going so far as to often tear the sleeves off of hoodies. She is only comfortable with sleeves when they\u2019re part of a cool jacket, or it\u2019s freezing cold. She virtually always chooses full length pants and boots, but on the rare occasion she doesn\u2019t, she will choose light and airy shorts and open-toed footwear. She will sooner kill everyone in the room than wear a skirt, high heels, or anything with frills. Special abilities \u00b6 She wields Attunement to its fullest potential, able to do quite literally anything short of a feat of creation on her own, but when she, Kerosyn, and Florian work together, they become seemingly omnipotent, capable of reality-altering feats of unknown magnitude. The three of them also seem to share some type of telepathic link, which allows them to always know each other\u2019s location and to share strong feelings, but does not allow them to communicate directly. Her alignment makes her capable of seeing, hearing, and feeling everything on a global scale, possibly even further. This ability is \u201calways-on\u201d in the sense that she always has some perception of everything, but she must specifically focus on the ability to perceive it as anything other than background noise. She is capable of taking in and fully comprehending everything all at once, but it is a massive drain on her both mentally and physically, so she mainly focuses on specific parts of the world at a time, and keeps an \u201cear\u201d open for particularly interesting events. She may not be omniscient, but she\u2019d be the prime candidate for it. With that in mind, it must be said that her hearing, vision, and reflexes are almost supernaturally good even without utilizing her alignment. Her signature use of power is to teleport objects, most often her bikes and guns. A fan of the dramatic, she might even teleport in a gun, fire all the loaded ammunition, then teleport it away and replace it with another one instead of reloading or teleporting more ammo into it. She can teleport living things as well, but prefers not to, claiming that it\u2019s quite exhausting. Her power manifests mostly as streaks of lightning or static electricity on and around some part of her body along with whatever she\u2019s manipulating. As an immortal being, she cannot truly die even if she is \u201ckilled\u201d. If she was shot through the heart and the head, she would just stand back up in a few seconds. She could be decapitated and simply wake back up in a matter of minutes if someone put her head back in place, though the wound would take longer than that to fully heal. In the event she can\u2019t simply wake back up, her corpse will disintegrate completely and she will regenerate in the place she was first buried and wake up there instead, though that may take an awfully long time. Personality \u00b6 Freya is a sly, tomboyish flirt overflowing with confidence and charisma who has absolutely zero shame. She is a master of sweet talking and banter, and steals the spotlight wherever she goes, capable of commanding the attention of every person in a crowded bar just by walking in the door, along with nonchalantly talking her way into, out of, or around just about any situation while humiliating others in the process. She carries herself with a fierce and suggestive swagger, nearly always striking something between arrogance and seduction in her idle body language. She is very expressive, almost always wearing a big toothy grin, giggles and laughs a lot, and always has fire in her eyes. She\u2019s also bursting with snark and attitude, even to those closest to her. She tends to view other people as mere pieces in a game that she happens to be very good at playing, and has a very weak sense of morality, allowing her to lie, cheat, and manipulate people frequently to fulfill her whims and indulgences without guilt. She is no stranger to using her body to her advantage, and will not hesitate to leave in the night without a word, taking whatever she wants with her. Lust aside, she also takes great pleasure in humiliating or dominating others, both verbally and physically, even enjoying inflicting pain and cruelty on people she dislikes, and there are few that she hates more than those who act weak and fearful. She enjoys violence to an almost disturbing degree, especially when she believes it\u2019s justified. Her cravings for these indulgences are constant, and they become harder for her to resist when she\u2019s bored and restless\u2026 which happens often. She does not value her own safety at all and is all too happy to run head first into her death if she can have fun with it. Beneath her rough, vulgar, generally not-very-nice outer appearance though, she still has the capacity for compassion and affection, and yearns for real intimate connections. She has extreme difficulty forming new relationships, and even more difficulty maintaining positive ones, leading her to cherish strongly the few friends she may have at any given time. There is no better way to make a good first impression with Freya than to be bold enough to stand up to her, so her friends tend to be quite similar to herself. In private and among close friends, she can calm down dramatically and seem like a completely different person. She may actually express compassion and affection openly, and on some occasions, can even be rather delicate and feminine. With the amount of trust it takes for her to let her guard down, chances are that anyone who sees this side of her is already her friend for life. Deep within her heart, she resents her violent nature, so she immerses herself in hobbies to distract from it. Despite living for so long and being capable of mastering anything she puts her mind to, she has a quite limited set of interests and doesn\u2019t often branch out from them. Currently, she\u2019s fixated on building and riding motorcycles, gunsmithing and marksmanship, and metalworking, and is among the best in the world at these things thanks to her stellar 3D visualization skills and intuitive understanding of physics and material science. Fighting style \u00b6 Always a fan of the dramatic, she loves to fight in one of two ways with no middle ground if she can help it. Either an explosive show of force capable of dominating the opponent immediately, or allowing the opponent to believe they\u2019re winning - even if that means letting them \u201ckill\u201d her - before simply shrugging it all off and dominating them anyway. The ultimate goal either way is the same: To demoralize and humiliate. She revels in the fear and hysteria of her targets, always taunting and laughing at them, sometimes even going so far as to prolong the fight as long as possible even after she has clearly won for her own indulgence. Relationships \u00b6 Having spent close to their entire lives together, Kerosyn, Freya, and Florian are family in all but blood relation. Freya is the oldest of the three. Freya sees Kerosyn as a younger sibling and is quite protective of them. The two of them share an inseparable bond that runs so deep, Freya is the only person capable of talking Kerosyn out of anger, and one of the only people who can tell what they\u2019re truly feeling behind their happy demeanor just by looking. They don\u2019t share many of the same interests, but love talking about them together regardless. They bring each other a lot of comfort just by being near. They have kept their matching pendants since the day they met. She sees Florian as a brother, but they treat each other more like workplace colleagues most of the time due to their very different personalities and interests. While they may not be nearly as close as she is with Kerosyn, she will still stand up for Florian whenever he needs help. Of course, she also enjoys picking on him frequently, but is mindful enough to never take it too far. The relationship between these three can sometimes appear more parental than that of siblings due to Kerosyn\u2019s childlike nature, though they all vehemently reject the idea of that. Freya is extremely close friends with Minerva . They met several years before she met Kerosyn, when Freya was only a teenager. Minerva was isolated in hiding, and Freya was a runaway looking for somewhere to hide. They brought out the best in each other, helped each other overcome their weaknesses, and quickly became best friends. She makes regular visits to this day, often times bringing Kerosyn and Florian with her. Freya is something of an adoptive mother to Garm , though their relationship often outwardly appears more like that of a master and their loyal dog. They both have fun with that arrangement, but when it\u2019s quiet, they do truly act like mother and daughter. Anybody familiar with the two of them can see that bond even through the odd public appearance. She also has very close friendly relationships with Dvalinn and Kuhai , who she enjoys playfully picking on, plus Haida and Neven , who she treats much more respectfully. The five of them are like Freya\u2019s second family. Seth Alden is close to this group as well, and as much as they like him, he maintains a degree of professional separation. Seeing all of those people happy has become Freya\u2019s primary - if not only - source of genuine happiness over the centuries, so she goes out of her way to spend time with them, protect them, and help them with whatever she can. She cherishes them all more than anything and is quite protective of them. Additionally, she has a friendly relationship with Nikolai Anatolyevich Litvyak , the only fighter pilot to outlast her in a dogfight. Once she recovered from being shot down, she fiercely, single-mindedly tracked him down, her intention being merely to learn his name, but the moment he learned who she was, he defected to the Risky Witches, his intention being merely to fly with her again. His granddaughter, Raisa Ivanovna Litvyak , resents them both and vowed to shoot them both down herself should they ever meet in the sky. Affiliations \u00b6 Being one of the three deities of the Children of the Flame, Freya is very strongly affiliated with them. She finds what their followers think about her to be pretty funny, but really hates being treated like a god, so she tries very hard to avoid the organization and its members, even going so far as to tell The Sixth Storyteller not to share any identifiable information about her with the members so she can avoid being recognized. She does occasionally meet with him personally though, mostly to keep him informed. History \u00b6 Some of Freya\u2019s history during Era Dira is described in The Account . Freya has had a long career of interfering with military affairs. Here is a list of military units that Freya directly joined. Deadeye Relics - Scout infantry Iron Wings - Cavalry unit Sandman (unit) - Night attack infantry Werewolf (unit) - Night attack infantry Vampire Squadron - Ground strike fighter squadron Sorcerer Squadron - Air superiority fighter squadron Witch Squadron - Multirole fighter squadron Unnamed Destrean rebel group - Guerrillas, precursor to the Risky Witches About these units Until these links point to pages that exist and have content in them, the names should be considered placeholder for everything except the Witch Squadron. I just came up with them all off the cuff one night because I wanted something to list here that reflects the timeline leading up to the Risky Witches. Trivia \u00b6 Freya, despite her immortality, still needs to eat and drink to survive like a regular person. If she starves to death, she will come back in the same condition for a short time, then die again, over and over until she gets food.

She will often wear the jacket around her waist or take it off entirely to suit the circumstances. She also wears and ancient fire-damaged brass pendant that displays a cherry blossom, held on a red leather necklace. This pendant is one of a matching pair, the other belonging to Kerosyn. When not wearing that outfit, she strongly prefers flashy masculine clothing, tends to lean towards dark colors plus black and white, has a penchant for stripes, and prefers tops with either no sleeves or very short ones, going so far as to often tear the sleeves off of hoodies. She is only comfortable with sleeves when they\u2019re part of a cool jacket, or it\u2019s freezing cold. She virtually always chooses full length pants and boots, but on the rare occasion she doesn\u2019t, she will choose light and airy shorts and open-toed footwear.

The three of them also seem to share some type of telepathic link, which allows them to always know each other\u2019s location and to share strong feelings, but does not allow them to communicate directly. Her alignment makes her capable of seeing, hearing, and feeling everything on a global scale, possibly even further. This ability is \u201calways-on\u201d in the sense that she always has some perception of everything, but she must specifically focus on the ability to perceive it as anything other than background noise. She is capable of taking in and fully comprehending everything all at once, but it is a massive drain on her both mentally and physically, so she mainly focuses on specific parts of the world at a time, and keeps an \u201cear\u201d open for particularly interesting events. She may not be omniscient, but she\u2019d be the prime candidate for it. With that in mind, it must be said that her hearing, vision, and reflexes are almost supernaturally good even without utilizing her alignment. Her signature use of power is to teleport objects, most often her bikes and guns. A fan of the dramatic, she might even teleport in a gun, fire all the loaded ammunition, then teleport it away and replace it with another one instead of reloading or teleporting more ammo into it. She can teleport living things as well, but prefers not to, claiming that it\u2019s quite exhausting. Her power manifests mostly as streaks of lightning or static electricity on and around some part of her body along with whatever she\u2019s manipulating. As an immortal being, she cannot truly die even if she is \u201ckilled\u201d. If she was shot through the heart and the head, she would just stand back up in a few seconds. She could be decapitated and simply wake back up in a matter of minutes if someone put her head back in place, though the wound would take longer than that to fully heal. In the event she can\u2019t simply wake back up, her corpse will disintegrate completely and she will regenerate in the place she was first buried and wake up there instead, though that may take an awfully long time.","title":"Special abilities"},{"location":"Nova-Regna/Characters/Incarnations%20%26%20Gods/Freya/#personality","text":"Freya is a sly, tomboyish flirt overflowing with confidence and charisma who has absolutely zero shame. She is a master of sweet talking and banter, and steals the spotlight wherever she goes, capable of commanding the attention of every person in a crowded bar just by walking in the door, along with nonchalantly talking her way into, out of, or around just about any situation while humiliating others in the process. She carries herself with a fierce and suggestive swagger, nearly always striking something between arrogance and seduction in her idle body language. She is very expressive, almost always wearing a big toothy grin, giggles and laughs a lot, and always has fire in her eyes. She\u2019s also bursting with snark and attitude, even to those closest to her. She tends to view other people as mere pieces in a game that she happens to be very good at playing, and has a very weak sense of morality, allowing her to lie, cheat, and manipulate people frequently to fulfill her whims and indulgences without guilt. She is no stranger to using her body to her advantage, and will not hesitate to leave in the night without a word, taking whatever she wants with her. Lust aside, she also takes great pleasure in humiliating or dominating others, both verbally and physically, even enjoying inflicting pain and cruelty on people she dislikes, and there are few that she hates more than those who act weak and fearful. She enjoys violence to an almost disturbing degree, especially when she believes it\u2019s justified. Her cravings for these indulgences are constant, and they become harder for her to resist when she\u2019s bored and restless\u2026 which happens often. She does not value her own safety at all and is all too happy to run head first into her death if she can have fun with it. Beneath her rough, vulgar, generally not-very-nice outer appearance though, she still has the capacity for compassion and affection, and yearns for real intimate connections. She has extreme difficulty forming new relationships, and even more difficulty maintaining positive ones, leading her to cherish strongly the few friends she may have at any given time. There is no better way to make a good first impression with Freya than to be bold enough to stand up to her, so her friends tend to be quite similar to herself. In private and among close friends, she can calm down dramatically and seem like a completely different person. She may actually express compassion and affection openly, and on some occasions, can even be rather delicate and feminine. With the amount of trust it takes for her to let her guard down, chances are that anyone who sees this side of her is already her friend for life. Deep within her heart, she resents her violent nature, so she immerses herself in hobbies to distract from it. Despite living for so long and being capable of mastering anything she puts her mind to, she has a quite limited set of interests and doesn\u2019t often branch out from them. Currently, she\u2019s fixated on building and riding motorcycles, gunsmithing and marksmanship, and metalworking, and is among the best in the world at these things thanks to her stellar 3D visualization skills and intuitive understanding of physics and material science.","title":"Personality"},{"location":"Nova-Regna/Characters/Incarnations%20%26%20Gods/Freya/#fighting-style","text":"Always a fan of the dramatic, she loves to fight in one of two ways with no middle ground if she can help it. Either an explosive show of force capable of dominating the opponent immediately, or allowing the opponent to believe they\u2019re winning - even if that means letting them \u201ckill\u201d her - before simply shrugging it all off and dominating them anyway. The ultimate goal either way is the same: To demoralize and humiliate. She revels in the fear and hysteria of her targets, always taunting and laughing at them, sometimes even going so far as to prolong the fight as long as possible even after she has clearly won for her own indulgence.","title":"Fighting style"},{"location":"Nova-Regna/Characters/Incarnations%20%26%20Gods/Freya/#relationships","text":"Having spent close to their entire lives together, Kerosyn, Freya, and Florian are family in all but blood relation. Freya is the oldest of the three. Freya sees Kerosyn as a younger sibling and is quite protective of them. The two of them share an inseparable bond that runs so deep, Freya is the only person capable of talking Kerosyn out of anger, and one of the only people who can tell what they\u2019re truly feeling behind their happy demeanor just by looking. They don\u2019t share many of the same interests, but love talking about them together regardless. They bring each other a lot of comfort just by being near. They have kept their matching pendants since the day they met. She sees Florian as a brother, but they treat each other more like workplace colleagues most of the time due to their very different personalities and interests. While they may not be nearly as close as she is with Kerosyn, she will still stand up for Florian whenever he needs help. Of course, she also enjoys picking on him frequently, but is mindful enough to never take it too far. The relationship between these three can sometimes appear more parental than that of siblings due to Kerosyn\u2019s childlike nature, though they all vehemently reject the idea of that. Freya is extremely close friends with Minerva . They met several years before she met Kerosyn, when Freya was only a teenager. Minerva was isolated in hiding, and Freya was a runaway looking for somewhere to hide. They brought out the best in each other, helped each other overcome their weaknesses, and quickly became best friends. She makes regular visits to this day, often times bringing Kerosyn and Florian with her. Freya is something of an adoptive mother to Garm , though their relationship often outwardly appears more like that of a master and their loyal dog. They both have fun with that arrangement, but when it\u2019s quiet, they do truly act like mother and daughter. Anybody familiar with the two of them can see that bond even through the odd public appearance. She also has very close friendly relationships with Dvalinn and Kuhai , who she enjoys playfully picking on, plus Haida and Neven , who she treats much more respectfully. The five of them are like Freya\u2019s second family. Seth Alden is close to this group as well, and as much as they like him, he maintains a degree of professional separation. Seeing all of those people happy has become Freya\u2019s primary - if not only - source of genuine happiness over the centuries, so she goes out of her way to spend time with them, protect them, and help them with whatever she can. She cherishes them all more than anything and is quite protective of them. Additionally, she has a friendly relationship with Nikolai Anatolyevich Litvyak , the only fighter pilot to outlast her in a dogfight. Once she recovered from being shot down, she fiercely, single-mindedly tracked him down, her intention being merely to learn his name, but the moment he learned who she was, he defected to the Risky Witches, his intention being merely to fly with her again. His granddaughter, Raisa Ivanovna Litvyak , resents them both and vowed to shoot them both down herself should they ever meet in the sky.","title":"Relationships"},{"location":"Nova-Regna/Characters/Incarnations%20%26%20Gods/Freya/#affiliations","text":"Being one of the three deities of the Children of the Flame, Freya is very strongly affiliated with them.

Every incarnation of Garm shares a number of constant traits, including wild black hair, deep silver eyes, absolute ambidexterity, and an unusual, rather unsettling gait. They possess Attunement that manifests as monstrous physical strength and durability, and an invisible force that increases their offensive range and perception, but these abilities are both utilized subconsciously.

Physical description \u00b6 General Physical Condition \u00b6 Athletic, rectangle shaped body, toned and slender. She is in peak physical condition. Basically she\u2019s just a skinnier, wilder version of Freya. Body Features \u00b6 Pale skinned Has a raggedy black wolf tail, and wolf ears. Fingernails are sharp and pointed. Facial Features \u00b6 Black, long with short bangs, fluffy and raggedy hair, tied low and messy in the back Deep silver eyes Eyes are sharp and wide with slight wrinkles from being angry all the time. Pointed teeth with\u2003 very \u2003pronounced upper and lower canines. Physical quirks\u2003\u2003 \u00b6 Bares her teeth pretty much all the time, whatever the emotion. Her angry face is horrifying. Has an antalgic gait. Apparel & Accessories \u00b6 Black cadet cap Short black trench coat White gauze wrapping around chest Black fingerless \u201ctactical\u201d gloves Red waist sash Black cargo jeans with\u2003 many \u2003pockets Black hiking boots Dual battle axes in underarm holsters Issue The whole physical description heading is old info that I won\u2019t be bothering to update until I get a visual representation of her, which may look quite different. At that point, this section of the page will be updated with proper formatting based on that. Special abilities \u00b6 Garm\u2019s attunement primarily manifests itself as an invisible force that increases her offensive range and perception subconsciously. This gives her an innate sense of presence, allowing her to vaguely know when a person is nearby, or have a feeling of impending doom when danger is approaching. In combat, this sense allows her to much more accurately predict incoming attacks and react faster, and her range will increase up to double her natural arm\u2019s reach. This force can hit with blunt force, a sharp edge, or a fine point depending on what she has in her hands. Some people with alignment may be able to somehow see this force, but to everyone else, it is entirely invisible. As an incarnation, her attunement also gives her immense, supernatural strength and physical durability, allowing her to lift more than three times her body weight, punch and kick with the force of a small car, and not just survive falls from 20 stories, but walk away from them. Personality \u00b6 With her fierce devotion to Freya and thanks to spending so much time with her, Garm mostly imitates Freya. She is nowhere near as good at smooth talking or flirting as Freya is, but she did inherit the boundless confidence and shamelessness, so she always tries her best. Garm had virtually no childhood, and the full extent of her education came from soldiers in the Risky Witches, so there is a lot she doesn\u2019t know or understand. That combined with Freya\u2019s influence, traumatic experiences earlier in her life, and her nature as an incarnation, has left her as an eternal teenager. Childish, arrogant, ignorant, naive, short-tempered, and combative. She has developed a degree of empathy and compassion since being taken in, but it\u2019s reserved exclusively for people she knows and likes or has been taught to protect. With anybody else, she displays no empathy or compassion at all, or even any respect for their lives. This leads to her treating the enemy in combat as little more than toys for her to enjoy tearing apart like a mad dog. Motivation \u00b6 Unlike the rest of the incarnations, Garm has no particular motivation of her own. Instead, her motivation is simply to loyally serve a strong master, which is currently Freya. Relationships \u00b6 Garm was effectively raised by Freya and sees her both as her master and as a mother, though their relationship often outwardly appears more like that of a pet owner and their loyal dog. They both have fun with that arrangement, but when it\u2019s quiet, they do truly act like mother and daughter. Anybody familiar with the two of them can see that bond even through the odd public appearance. Since she was taken in by Freya in the early days of the Risky Witches, she is quite close with many of the oldest members of the organization as well - who are very proud of her - and is quite protective of them. She is also very close with Dvalinn , Kuhai , Haida , and Neven thanks to Freya bringing them all together. She treats Dvalinn like a little brother (despite being younger than him) and picks on him a lot, much to his dismay. She sees Kuhai as a rival and enjoys fighting with her. She looks up to Neven like an older sister, and to Haida like a grandmother. Affiliations \u00b6 She is a member of the Risky Witches Task Force 5555 with the effective rank of O-6. History \u00b6 sorry nothing Trivia \u00b6 She got the nickname \u201cBiscuit\u201d from soldiers before the Risky Witches formed for acting so much like a dog loyal to Freya, even being eager to receive treats for good behavior. She has broken almost every bone in her body at least twice each, and has broken her arms so many times in so many places that those bones have become freakishly hard, even by her standards.

Special abilities \u00b6 Her alignment and attunement go hand in hand to enable her to project her senses over long distances, effectively allowing her to listen to conversations from the other side of the world as though she were in the room, communicate telepathically with, read the emotions of, or create grand, complex, extremely convincing illusions for one person at a time over long distances, or up to 50 people at a time within visual range. Her abilities can also synergize with the abilities of others through physical contact if they\u2019re compatible.

She does not enjoy physical contact and typically prefers a large area of personal space, but will not hesitate to offer pats and hugs to people she is familiar with when they are feeling down. It is exceedingly rare to find Haida with anything other than a smile on her face and kindness in her words. While her good nature is genuine, it also hides a colder side. Quietly, she is always keeping tabs on the people around her and building detailed profiles of them in her head, which she never forgets. With a cold, calculative mind, she uses this knowledge to subtly affect everyone around her and steer the course of their lives, and even though her intentions are good, it tends to make people uncomfortable as they pick up on that, turning her eternal smile from something warm and comforting to something cold and unnerving. She calls herself a pacifist, but not only does she support the violence caused by the Risky Witches, she actively participates from the sidelines by keeping units informed and coordinated, and sometimes even subjects the enemy to her illusions, knowing that it will lead to their deaths. This, too, she does with a smile. Support of the Risky Witches is, however, the only exception to her pacifism, and she is extremely quick to oppose and attempt to prevent violence from being committed around her without ever raising a hand. Her reason for making the exception is a confusing mystery to everyone, even those closest to her. Relationships \u00b6 Haida, for the most part, has a strange mix of close familiarity and cold distance with everyone around her, which makes most people feel safe and comfortable around her at first, before slowly becoming more and more uncomfortable without understanding why. Out of everyone in the Risky Witches, Neven is the only one she is truly close to, and she greatly enjoys their time together. Dvalinn is close to her as well, even though she treats him the same as everyone else, because he views her strange coldness as something to look up to. Garm is dense enough to simply not care, and Kuhai is simply unfazed. She is also close with Minerva and all of the mouse spirits working and living with her, showing them more affection than anyone else, though Neven has earned second place in her heart.

They are one of the three deities of the Children of the Flame , along with Freya and Florian . Physical description \u00b6 Kerosyn has a short, slim, androgynous build. They are largely featureless, something like a living silhouette. They have large fox ears, very pronounced fangs, four large tails, and digitigrade feet. Perhaps most immediately noticeable is their complete lack of eyes and eye sockets, with only the Brand glowing bright red between where they should be. Their body is primarily made of white flames, which is most apparent by looking at their ears, \u201chair\u201d, or tails. These flames grow and shrink in size, become brighter and dimmer, and \u201cburn\u201d at different speeds depending on their mood. Small wisps of the same white flames are also kicked up where they step. None of these flames burn things, and are cool to the touch. Despite being made of flame, one can still touch Kerosyn and aside from the cold temperature, it would feel as you would expect as though it were skin and fur. Beneath the flames, there is a regular skeleton. It is extremely rare for this skeleton to be visible due to the brightness of the flames, but sometimes one may catch a shadowy glimpse of it. The skeleton is the only part of Kerosyn that has any weight, but despite that, they have the same resistance to being pushed and shoved as someone of average weight for their height. A large butterfly glowing bright white can be seen fluttering around Kerosyn at all times. It\u2019s never far from arm\u2019s reach. It is presumed that the butterfly is somehow a part of them, but exactly why it\u2019s there, only Kerosyn, Freya, and Florian know. Clothing \u00b6 Kerosyn wears a white vest, a high collared white jacket with elaborate red leather trim, red leather gloves, and white pants with tattered legs. They also wear an ancient fire-damaged brass pendant that displays a cherry blossom, held on a red gemstone. This pendant is one of a matching pair, the other belonging to Freya. Kerosyn may occasionally take off the jacket to suit certain situations, but is otherwise nearly always wearing this signature outfit. On the rare occasion they aren\u2019t wearing it, what they wear instead is anyone\u2019s guess, because Kerosyn will try on anything without objection, and will enjoy every moment of it\u2026 though, shoes don\u2019t fit on them so they can\u2019t really try those on. These moments never last long, however, because Kerosyn\u2019s signature outfit is the only outfit they really feel comfortable in. Special abilities \u00b6 Kerosyn wields Attunement to its fullest potential, able to do quite literally anything short of a feat of creation on their own, but when they, Freya, and Florian work together, they become seemingly omnipotent, capable of reality-altering feats of unknown magnitude. The three of them also seem to share some type of telepathic link, which allows them to always know each other\u2019s location and to share strong feelings, but does not allow them to communicate directly. Finally, their Alignment gives them some kind of esoteric connection to the world as a whole. They may not be able to match Freya\u2019s perception skills, but their gut feelings are always pertinent and never wrong. Their power manifests primarily as fire, most notably by the fact that their entire body is a supernatural white fire, but can take any form. Unlike Freya and Florian, they don\u2019t really have a signature use of power, instead preferring to just do whatever they want with it, be it for entertainment, convenience, the benefit of others, or any other reason. They use their power far more liberally than their siblings, willing to perform miracles for others on a whim and are completely oblivious to what others think of that. It also comes in handy when they burn their clothes to ashes for the thousandth time, because they can just materialize some new duds. The same power should actually help them prevent burning their clothes off in the first place, but let\u2019s just say they aren\u2019t perfect. As an entirely immortal being, they cannot die. Their body is very durable, but not to godlike standards. Their bones will still break and their \u201cskin\u201d can still be cut. Their true godlike bodily quality is that of regeneration. When they do get cut, they will \u201cbleed\u201d wild, violent flames before the wound seals closed in a matter of seconds, and when their bones are broken, they will regenerate in a few minutes if kept very still. Remove a part of their body and it can simply be put back on within the first few minutes, or the lost part will simply fade out of existence after a while and they\u2019ll regrow it over a day or two. Decapitation is the only thing that has no effect at all on them, as any weapon will simply pass through their neck without resistance due to a few missing vertebrae, and pulling on their head - no matter how strongly - will simply lift their whole body with it. Being mostly incorporeal, Kerosyn is also capable of temporarily shapeshifting into just about anything up to four times their size, but their skeleton prevents them from shrinking. How long the alteration lasts depends on the size difference, complexity, and subsequent exertion. They often use this ability unconsciously to signify their mood. For instance, growing their fangs in both size and number when angry, displaying something similar to regular human teeth when smiling, or taking on a more corporeal and fluffy appearance when happy or comforting others. Personality \u00b6 Kerosyn is an extremely friendly and compassionate person who is virtually always visibly happy. They have a strong moral compass, stand by it firmly, and will stand up for anyone and everyone without hesitation. They are also extremely curious, naive, easily distracted, and tend to giggle and laugh a lot. They pretty much just want to have fun and spread positivity, always seeking out new experiences and happily involving themselves with society, totally oblivious to how much they stand out and how other people might react to their presence, even becoming frustrated when they are treated in any special way. They take great pride in their friends and teachers and cherish the memories of them more than almost anything else. While Kerosyn overflows with charisma and confidence, their oblivious and immature nature takes away a lot of potential advantages that would bring, since they come off more like a lovable but dumb kid than someone worth seriously talking to. Their short attention span and penchant for pranks don\u2019t help matters either. That said, if one could hold their attention and talk about something they\u2019re passionate about, they can hold long and deep conversations just fine. Naturally, that\u2019s not an easy thing to achieve, so many of their friends are actually children since they often get along better due to their interests tending to align more frequently, along with the facts that children are both much less scared of them, and treat them more like an equal than most adults. They\u2019re the king of the playground, and the ultimate bully-stopper. Kerosyn carries themselves like a happy, but fidgety child, even in highly inappropriate situations. Don\u2019t invite them to funerals. They make up for their lack of expressive eyes with extremely expressive and exaggerated body language, especially with their ears and tails. Curiously, they even maintain their happy demeanor when they are absolutely not happy, sometimes even giggling when one would think they\u2019d be crying. It takes a lot to get them to truly express any other emotion rather than subtly hinting at it. It is possible to get them to act mature, but extremely difficult. When it happens, it\u2019s as though they become an entirely different person. Wise, elegant, and serene, surrounded by what can only be described as a divine air. The few who know this side of Kerosyn can consider themselves blessed since it\u2019s such a rare sight. Kerosyn is very eager to learn anything and everything, but it\u2019s difficult to teach them as they are a horrible listener. They learn best by doing. Another challenge is overcoming their short attention span, but if it\u2019s something they really want to learn about, they will try their best to be a good student. They\u2019ll probably never become a true master of anything though. Their hidden talents are extensive intuitive knowledge of nature, inter- and intra-personal emotions, and the existential\u2026 though their true strength is their infinite wisdom rather than their limited intellect, and even that is rarely seen in action since they\u2019re usually too busy being a goofball. Something extra Some have theorized but none can prove that Kerosyn is potentially suffering from a complex case of PTSD, causing their apparent age regression. Another theory is that the age regression is a side effect of Kerosyn\u2019s resurrection (described in The Account), their brain having been permanently damaged. Only Freya and Florian know the full truth of this matter, but they confirm that Kerosyn\u2019s age regression is the result of extreme repression caused by equally extreme trauma. The reason it\u2019s so rare to see Kerosyn acting mature and wise is because it takes an immense amount of energy to not only access what has been repressed, but hold back the undesirable aspects. Those undesirable aspects are what is seen in action when they enter their \u201cangry\u201d state. The \u201cangry\u201d state \u00b6 When Kerosyn gets truly angry, they become what can only be described as the physical embodiment of fury. They no longer communicate at all, only screaming and growling, they become extremely violent and animalistic, and their powers run wild. It\u2019s not wrong to think they could destroy the world as we know it in a fit of anger, single handedly; they did it once before . The only ways to bring them out of a fit like this are to let it run its course, physically fight them hard enough to tire them out, or be Freya and give them a proper scolding. Fighting styles \u00b6 Kerosyn has three distinct fighting styles. First is the playful style. They will dodge attacks with exaggerated, almost comedic movements, but will take a hit or two on purpose to keep it going. They won\u2019t attack seriously, but will throw play punches that wouldn\u2019t hurt anyone. They\u2019re not big on taunting, but will laugh a lot. Next is the focused style. They go quiet and their stance changes to something more appropriate for a fight. Their dodges become beautifully elegant, not allowing themselves to take a single avoidable hit and blocking or parrying the rest. They will now attack seriously, but only when it\u2019s a sure shot, and they will not aim to kill unless there\u2019s no other choice. In this state, trails of fire string from their hands and feet, making his movements look something like a ribbon dance. This sight is what inspired the Firekeepers of the Children of the Flame. Finally, the enraged style. All bets are off now. No more dodging, they\u2019ll just take every hit and ignore the damage, even something as serious as losing a limb. They will be hellbent on the offensive, wild and unpredictable, and will absolutely not be shy about biting hard and tearing flesh. Fortunately, even in this state they\u2019re still not quite \u201cangry\u201d, so destruction of the world isn\u2019t a concern, though it\u2019s just as hard to snap him out of it. Relationships \u00b6 Having spent close to their entire lives together, Kerosyn, Freya, and Florian are family in all but blood relation. Kerosyn is the youngest of the three. Kerosyn sees both Freya and Florian as elder siblings, but is particularly close with Freya. The two of them share an inseparable bond that runs so deep, Freya is the only person capable of talking Kerosyn out of anger, and one of the only people who can tell what they\u2019re truly feeling behind their happy demeanor just by looking. They don\u2019t share many of the same interests, but love talking about them together regardless. They bring each other a lot of comfort just by being near. They have kept their matching pendants since the day they met. Florian is more of a teacher and rival to Kerosyn. They enjoy learning from Florian, but their clashing personalities lead to a lot of playful competition, though Kerosyn is often the only one having fun. They also get into fights occasionally, usually caused by Florian\u2019s patience running out while Kerosyn remains oblivious to that. The relationship between these three can sometimes appear more parental than that of siblings due to Kerosyn\u2019s childlike nature, though they all vehemently reject the idea of that. Affiliations \u00b6 Being one of the three deities of the Children of the Flame and the most visually distinctive, Kerosyn is very strongly affiliated with them. They hate the attention though, and especially hate being worshiped, so they try very hard to avoid the organization and its members. The one exception to that is The Sixth Storyteller , because he respects Kerosyn\u2019s wish to be treated as an equal, so he keeps Kerosyn informed and relays information from them back to the organization. History \u00b6 Most of Kerosyn\u2019s history during Era Dira is described in The Account . Trivia \u00b6 Kerosyn has no need to eat or sleep at all, but enjoys doing those things anyway. Kerosyn\u2019s love of food has made them not only a great cook, but a skilled farmer as well. Kerosyn has both perfect pitch and perfect rhythm. They are proficient with nearly all musical instruments that don\u2019t use a mouthpiece, can sing decently, and can both play and riff on anything just by hearing it once. Their favorite instrument to play is the drums. One might assume that Kerosyn has 360 degree vision based on their lack of eyes, but they actually see exactly the same as anyone else. How? Who knows? Kerosyn sure doesn\u2019t. Kerosyn is the type of person to latch onto new trends and run them into the ground hard, then keep holding onto them long past the point of embarrassment.

When they do get cut, they will \u201cbleed\u201d wild, violent flames before the wound seals closed in a matter of seconds, and when their bones are broken, they will regenerate in a few minutes if kept very still. Remove a part of their body and it can simply be put back on within the first few minutes, or the lost part will simply fade out of existence after a while and they\u2019ll regrow it over a day or two. Decapitation is the only thing that has no effect at all on them, as any weapon will simply pass through their neck without resistance due to a few missing vertebrae, and pulling on their head - no matter how strongly - will simply lift their whole body with it. Being mostly incorporeal, Kerosyn is also capable of temporarily shapeshifting into just about anything up to four times their size, but their skeleton prevents them from shrinking. How long the alteration lasts depends on the size difference, complexity, and subsequent exertion. They often use this ability unconsciously to signify their mood. For instance, growing their fangs in both size and number when angry, displaying something similar to regular human teeth when smiling, or taking on a more corporeal and fluffy appearance when happy or comforting others.","title":"Special abilities"},{"location":"Nova-Regna/Characters/Incarnations%20%26%20Gods/Kerosyn/#personality","text":"Kerosyn is an extremely friendly and compassionate person who is virtually always visibly happy. They have a strong moral compass, stand by it firmly, and will stand up for anyone and everyone without hesitation. They are also extremely curious, naive, easily distracted, and tend to giggle and laugh a lot. They pretty much just want to have fun and spread positivity, always seeking out new experiences and happily involving themselves with society, totally oblivious to how much they stand out and how other people might react to their presence, even becoming frustrated when they are treated in any special way. They take great pride in their friends and teachers and cherish the memories of them more than almost anything else. While Kerosyn overflows with charisma and confidence, their oblivious and immature nature takes away a lot of potential advantages that would bring, since they come off more like a lovable but dumb kid than someone worth seriously talking to. Their short attention span and penchant for pranks don\u2019t help matters either. That said, if one could hold their attention and talk about something they\u2019re passionate about, they can hold long and deep conversations just fine. Naturally, that\u2019s not an easy thing to achieve, so many of their friends are actually children since they often get along better due to their interests tending to align more frequently, along with the facts that children are both much less scared of them, and treat them more like an equal than most adults. They\u2019re the king of the playground, and the ultimate bully-stopper. Kerosyn carries themselves like a happy, but fidgety child, even in highly inappropriate situations. Don\u2019t invite them to funerals. They make up for their lack of expressive eyes with extremely expressive and exaggerated body language, especially with their ears and tails. Curiously, they even maintain their happy demeanor when they are absolutely not happy, sometimes even giggling when one would think they\u2019d be crying. It takes a lot to get them to truly express any other emotion rather than subtly hinting at it. It is possible to get them to act mature, but extremely difficult. When it happens, it\u2019s as though they become an entirely different person. Wise, elegant, and serene, surrounded by what can only be described as a divine air. The few who know this side of Kerosyn can consider themselves blessed since it\u2019s such a rare sight. Kerosyn is very eager to learn anything and everything, but it\u2019s difficult to teach them as they are a horrible listener. They learn best by doing. Another challenge is overcoming their short attention span, but if it\u2019s something they really want to learn about, they will try their best to be a good student. They\u2019ll probably never become a true master of anything though. Their hidden talents are extensive intuitive knowledge of nature, inter- and intra-personal emotions, and the existential\u2026 though their true strength is their infinite wisdom rather than their limited intellect, and even that is rarely seen in action since they\u2019re usually too busy being a goofball. Something extra Some have theorized but none can prove that Kerosyn is potentially suffering from a complex case of PTSD, causing their apparent age regression. Another theory is that the age regression is a side effect of Kerosyn\u2019s resurrection (described in The Account), their brain having been permanently damaged. Only Freya and Florian know the full truth of this matter, but they confirm that Kerosyn\u2019s age regression is the result of extreme repression caused by equally extreme trauma. The reason it\u2019s so rare to see Kerosyn acting mature and wise is because it takes an immense amount of energy to not only access what has been repressed, but hold back the undesirable aspects. Those undesirable aspects are what is seen in action when they enter their \u201cangry\u201d state.","title":"Personality"},{"location":"Nova-Regna/Characters/Incarnations%20%26%20Gods/Kerosyn/#the-angry-state","text":"When Kerosyn gets truly angry, they become what can only be described as the physical embodiment of fury. They no longer communicate at all, only screaming and growling, they become extremely violent and animalistic, and their powers run wild. It\u2019s not wrong to think they could destroy the world as we know it in a fit of anger, single handedly; they did it once before . The only ways to bring them out of a fit like this are to let it run its course, physically fight them hard enough to tire them out, or be Freya and give them a proper scolding.","title":"The \"angry\" state"},{"location":"Nova-Regna/Characters/Incarnations%20%26%20Gods/Kerosyn/#fighting-styles","text":"Kerosyn has three distinct fighting styles. First is the playful style. They will dodge attacks with exaggerated, almost comedic movements, but will take a hit or two on purpose to keep it going. They won\u2019t attack seriously, but will throw play punches that wouldn\u2019t hurt anyone. They\u2019re not big on taunting, but will laugh a lot. Next is the focused style. They go quiet and their stance changes to something more appropriate for a fight. Their dodges become beautifully elegant, not allowing themselves to take a single avoidable hit and blocking or parrying the rest. They will now attack seriously, but only when it\u2019s a sure shot, and they will not aim to kill unless there\u2019s no other choice. In this state, trails of fire string from their hands and feet, making his movements look something like a ribbon dance. This sight is what inspired the Firekeepers of the Children of the Flame. Finally, the enraged style. All bets are off now. No more dodging, they\u2019ll just take every hit and ignore the damage, even something as serious as losing a limb. They will be hellbent on the offensive, wild and unpredictable, and will absolutely not be shy about biting hard and tearing flesh. Fortunately, even in this state they\u2019re still not quite \u201cangry\u201d, so destruction of the world isn\u2019t a concern, though it\u2019s just as hard to snap him out of it.","title":"Fighting styles"},{"location":"Nova-Regna/Characters/Incarnations%20%26%20Gods/Kerosyn/#relationships","text":"Having spent close to their entire lives together, Kerosyn, Freya, and Florian are family in all but blood relation. Kerosyn is the youngest of the three. Kerosyn sees both Freya and Florian as elder siblings, but is particularly close with Freya. The two of them share an inseparable bond that runs so deep, Freya is the only person capable of talking Kerosyn out of anger, and one of the only people who can tell what they\u2019re truly feeling behind their happy demeanor just by looking. They don\u2019t share many of the same interests, but love talking about them together regardless. They bring each other a lot of comfort just by being near. They have kept their matching pendants since the day they met. Florian is more of a teacher and rival to Kerosyn. They enjoy learning from Florian, but their clashing personalities lead to a lot of playful competition, though Kerosyn is often the only one having fun. They also get into fights occasionally, usually caused by Florian\u2019s patience running out while Kerosyn remains oblivious to that. The relationship between these three can sometimes appear more parental than that of siblings due to Kerosyn\u2019s childlike nature, though they all vehemently reject the idea of that.","title":"Relationships"},{"location":"Nova-Regna/Characters/Incarnations%20%26%20Gods/Kerosyn/#affiliations","text":"Being one of the three deities of the Children of the Flame and the most visually distinctive, Kerosyn is very strongly affiliated with them.

Every incarnation of Kuhai shares a number of constant traits, including their towering stature, piercing blue eyes, and ever since the sacrifice , a scar in the middle of their forehead resembling a bullet wound. They possess Attunement that manifests as monstrous physical strength and durability, and an invisible force that increases their offensive range and perception, both of which they wield consciously with calculated consideration.

Fully extended, the handle reaches 9 feet (2.75 meters), and it collapses to half that. Her ability to extend her attack reach through attunement affects this weapon too, giving her a ridiculous maximum effective reach of 24 feet (7.3 meters). Issue The whole physical description heading is old info that I won\u2019t be bothering to update until I get a visual representation of her, which may look quite different. At that point, this section of the page will be updated with proper formatting based on that. Special abilities \u00b6 Kuhai\u2019s attunement primarily manifests itself as an invisible force that increases her offensive range and perception, and a strong intuition that allows her to sense danger, intent, and hidden people. Her range can increase up to double the length of her arm or her weapon, whichever is longer, and the force can hit with a fine point, a sharp edge, or a wide blunt area. She has full conscious control over this ability, and can even utilize it to assist her with wielding unreasonably large or heavy weapons. Some people with alignment may be able to somehow see this force, but to everyone else, it is entirely invisible. As an incarnation, her attunement also gives her immense, supernatural strength and physical durability, allowing her to lift more than six times her body weight, punch and kick with the force of a truck, remain standing when hit with force up to that of a small car at 12 miles per hour, jump nearly twice as far up as her body height from a standstill, sustain severe blood loss without losing strength, and not just survive falls from 30 stories, but hit the ground running with no injuries. Out of all the incarnations, including the immortal three, Kuhai is the strongest, most imposing, and most fearsome. Even Freya fears her strength, despite the fact that she doesn\u2019t fear Kuhai as a person. This combined with her strong leadership and small army of loyal followers also makes her appear more like a god than any of the other incarnations, aside from Kerosyn . Her personality does not live up to her appearance, however. Personality \u00b6 Kuhai exudes a fierce and intimidating aura thanks to her imposing stature, piercing eyes, and permanent scowl, further exacerbated by her booming voice and tendency to speak bluntly. She takes full advantage of this as necessary to exercise her incredible leadership skills wherever they are needed, able to effectively command a small army single handedly, both in and out of combat. Beneath this appearance, however, is a surprisingly tender and compassionate soul. Above all, she cares about the safety of her people and takes every measure possible to ensure that she always hears their feelings and concerns, and is always kept aware of their conditions, always ready and willing to change or even abandon her plans or strategies if it means the safety of her people. Despite her godlike combat prowess and world-class military strategic skill and leadership ability, her ultimate desire is peace and security, and she will only fight when she believes that a victory is ensured and will bring her closer to that goal without unnecessary sacrifice. In smaller scale, more social environments, her adamant nature dissolves. Being in a leadership position and even venerated for most of her life, she has had close to zero meaningful social experience, leaving her anxious, easily flustered, and extremely awkward at times. Her social difficulties are made worse by her difficulties with learning anything that isn\u2019t either a physical activity or physically demonstrable. Because of that, she tends to avoid social activities and environments for her own comfort, but with people she knows and trusts, she tries her best to push through her anxiety and awkwardness, knowing it will make them happy\u2026 even though she has trouble understanding a lot of things. She can talk about combat, leadership, strategy, and fitness for hours without missing a beat, but not much else. Motivation \u00b6 Kuhai is primarily concerned with the safety of her people in her homeland of Isla Sofia , and secondarily concerned with the safety of Isla Sofia itself and all the people in it, and will go to extreme lengths to ensure no harm comes to them. Of course, that made her very easy for Freya to recruit to the Risky Witches by promising the safety of the island. Over time, Kuhai became invested in the greater cause of the Risky Witches and devoted herself to it entirely on the condition that Isla Sofia take priority should it ever be threatened. Relationships \u00b6 Kuhai\u2019s blunt and serious outward nature combined with her awkward and naive inner nature on top of her revered status in her homeland have historically made it difficult for her to form close relationships, but Freya changed that. She developed a huge crush on Freya at first sight and immediately accepted the invitation to the Risky Witches, which ended up being full of people much easier for her to talk to. She treats Dvalinn , Haida , and Neven with great respect and considers them great friends worth protecting. Garm , meanwhile, she sees more like an annoying younger relative, and is a little jealous of her closeness with Freya. Still someone worth protecting, but with less respect, leading to a lot of childish bickering and challenges. Despite that (or perhaps because of that) she is closest with Garm out of everyone in the unit, and they can often be found sparring together. Affiliations \u00b6 She is a member of the Risky Witches Task Force 5555 with the effective rank of O-6. History \u00b6 sorry nothing Trivia \u00b6 Most people believe her \u201cCharmer\u201d nickname came from her short temper and blunt words, but she actually got this nickname from trying to backtalk Freya. She failed miserably, got flustered, turned beet red, and stuttered up a storm, so she gave up and scurried away. And nobody close to her plans on letting her forget that any time soon. She speaks only two languages fluently. Everyone she knows in the Risky Witches speaks at least four languages fluently. She wants to learn more to keep up with everyone else, but has extreme difficulty with that and is ashamed of it.

This is what little info existed before this page did. Goddess of knowledge and wisdom. She is extremely reclusive to the point that not only does nobody know she exists, there isn\u2019t even any evidence of the massive library ( The Absolute Library ) she lives in physically existing. Housed inside a massive hollowed out mountain, she is in constant concentration manipulating the mystic matter around the mountain to hide any evidence of the mountain being out of the ordinary, and to repel people from coming close, save for the few mouse spirits that are seeking out the library to help her maintain it and her close friends, Kerosyn , Freya and Florian . She was born with an innate knowledge of everything that exists and all history, but does not possess foresight and cannot write prophecies, though she can make some very well educated guesses and be right most of the time. She is clumsy, extremely quiet - speaking almost in a whisper - and always tries her best to appear dignified and wise, but is very shy and will run away if she messes up a word or doesn\u2019t know how to respond to a question. However, when she\u2019s with people she\u2019s comfortable with and is coaxed out of her shell, she has a very goofy personality and acts a bit childish. She is very small and kind of frail, and usually looks kind of unkempt, only made worse by her tendency to wear clothes several sizes too big.

Unlike the other incarnations, Neven does not carry any constant physical traits throughout their generations. It is impossible to identify Neven until they reach adulthood, at which point their Alignment and Attunement develop fully, giving them psychometry, telepathy, and extremely powerful telekinesis.

There is nothing holding them together aside from her ability. She can use her telekinesis to weaponize them and put them back when done. She also carries a jian sword on her back with only her telekinesis, no straps or fasteners. She can track and control these things even far outside visual range.

At that point, this section of the page will be updated with proper formatting based on that. Special abilities \u00b6 Her alignment grants her telepathy limited within earshot. If anyone thinks near her, she will hear it as though they spoke, and anyone she telepathically communicates with will hear her voice as though she spoke. It also allows her to read deeper thoughts, emotions, and subconscious feelings of any person or animal she touches, and additionally grants psychometry that allows her to see the memories and history of people, animals, and inanimate objects as though she was present at the time by touching them. Her attunement grants her telekinesis limited within visual range. Like invisible hands, she can only manipulate objects when she can see them, or is fully aware of their location, like things inside a pocket, under a cover, or anything she moved behind herself. She can also apparently \u201cimprint\u201d on objects, allowing her to perceive and manipulate them even when outside of visual range, but it seems this only currently applies to her necklace, bracelets, anklets, sword, motorcycle, and helmet. As an incarnation, her attunement gives her the physical strength of a gymnast despite her featherlight weight, and also gives her drastically increased physical durability, endurance, and flexibility, allowing her to survive in extreme conditions, take heavy impacts without breaking a bone, and contort her body in ways that seem impossible. Her alignment also grants her virtually instant reaction speed, and her attunement gives her the control over her body needed to physically react at nearly the same speed, even if it means tearing her muscles in the process. Personality \u00b6 Neven\u2019s personality is fluid, rapidly adapting to suit her surroundings automatically, the severity of the adaptations depending on how strong the external influences are. One person with a lot of energy and extreme amounts of confidence - like Freya - can have as large of an effect on her as being in a small crowd in a public place. These adaptations can happen in as little as one minute, but can take hours to days of solitude to be undone. She is unable to suppress this, so her natural state is rarely seen since even being alone with one person will often cause her to take on personality traits from that person. Her natural state is quiet and stoic, full of compassion and an intense desire to learn about the world and the people around her. She also naturally has a silver tongue second only to Freya\u2019s, able to talk her way into or out of any kind of trouble with ease. These traits typically persist alongside her adaptations, aside from her quiet and stoic nature which is often lost entirely. Around Freya, she becomes playful, flirty, sly, and mischievous, and gets a kick out of slipping embarrassing things into conversations whenever she can, and this adaptation overpowers all others. The other incarnations also have strong influences on her, but nowhere near as strong as Freya. When Freya isn\u2019t around, the wild and loud nature of the people in the Risky Witches blur together into a chaotic mess of noise in her head, ultimately adding a silly, scatterbrained nature on top of whatever other personality changes appear at any given time. The cognitive load of this chaos also makes her rather clumsy and affects her balance, making her look drunk all the time. The only time she can overcome these adaptations without solitude is when exposed to a high stress, high stakes situation that requires her full attention, like saving a life, be it someone else\u2019s or her own, or while on non-trivial deployments with her unit. In these situations, all the noise in her head is silenced and she becomes cold, efficient, and hyperfocused on the task at hand. Motivation \u00b6 Neven has an innate desire for balance, but \u201cbalance\u201d being such a vague concept leads often to confusion and frustration. She has a foggy memory of a feeling that leads her to believe that all of her past lives devoted themselves to imposing their ideas of balance on their surroundings, but does not tell her what those ideas actually were, and that further frustrates Neven, so she has instead dedicated herself to traveling the world to study and come to a greater understanding of what \u201cbalance\u201d is, both in nature and in society. Since setting out on this quest when she was still a child, it has instilled a deep compassion for life in her, and her current idea of \u201cmaintaining balance\u201d is simply to help the people she encounters to live better lives. She was swayed to join the Risky Witches with the promise of liberation for spirits and marginalized people around the world, which aligned with her personal goals already. She is one of the most influential voices in the group that calls to minimize bloodshed. Relationships \u00b6 Neven is very close and friendly with Dvalinn , Garm , and Kuhai , treating them all like younger siblings and offering her support to them in every way she can, provided Freya isn\u2019t nearby to change her personality. She is especially close with Haida , because she looks up to her as a role model, and feels honored that Haida opened up to her in return. Out of the whole group, Neven is the most skeptical of Freya and tries to keep her at arm\u2019s length, which tends to appear outwardly as a rivalry. She also particularly wishes to be close with Seth Alden and offers him support wherever possible, but he makes it difficult with his attitude of deliberate distance. Unlike the others, though, Neven makes an active effort to break through his walls. Affiliations \u00b6 She is a member of the Risky Witches Task Force 5555 with the effective rank of O-6. History \u00b6 sorry nothing Trivia \u00b6 Her nickname, \u201cDizzy\u201d, is probably from her clumsy and scatterbrained nature during downtime with the Risky Witches. Or maybe it\u2019s from how she can switch from that to the cold and efficient super soldier so quickly that it makes people\u2019s heads spin. Who knows? Another reason she is so close with Haida is because Haida\u2019s abilities quiet the chaos in her head, allowing her some rare respite without solitude or stress. She will often be leaning on Haida, holding her shoulders, or carrying Haida on her own shoulders for that reason. See Also \u00b6 Meta Of course, Triumph doesn\u2019t exist in the world. Eventually it will be fictionalized. She owns a\u2003 Triumph Bonneville T120 that she travels the world on.

Filled with ideals and creative endeavors Seth was constantly forced into foregoing his own interests in order to keep in line with Concordia \u2018s image along with his families as a whole.\u2003\u2003 Seth was privately educated for most of his younger years by only the finest educators in (STATE NAME). Most of his remaining time was spent between following around his parents and playing around with mechanical parts and gizmos left behind in his grandfather\u2019s workshop, which would later spark interest for him to begin his own tinkering with things.\u2003 For much of his childhood all of the public appearances, volunteering, and other public showcases were all a game to him, but as time progressed and Seth got older the lack of being able to express himself and interact with others began to take its toll. Seeing this sudden lack of interest his parents decided it was best to enroll him in a private academy hoping being able to socialize with others his age would be what needed to motivate him into realizing the importance of his family name. This however did the opposite.\u2003 At first his peers didn\u2019t know how to approach him, more so those who were also coming from Corstaea \u2018s wealthier houses. Seth\u2019s honest and rather whimsical nature along with\u2003a rather strange and unnatural talent\u2003would soon prove that there was this earnest spirit amongst the rather serious and righteous aura associated with the Alden name. As more people began to open up to him Seth began to realize how much more enjoyable things were when he was surrounded by friends instead of constantly trying to appeal to the publics expectations. Because of this Seth would end his education with a rather diverse but close group of friends, both of commoner and nobility alike.\u2003\u2003 Though leaving school life also meant returning back to the pressures of upholding image along with now fulfilling the expectation of learning the business and preparing to be its rightful heir, or following the political route like his grandmother and upholding the political aspect of things. With much chagrin from his family, Seth decided to simply do neither, promising in a year he would have an answer. Fading from the spotlight initially caused some anxiety by the company and all parties involved but overtime realized that Arlette was not going anywhere anytime soon and his parents had Concordia in completely perfect control. So Seth was free to pursue his own interests and relationships, becoming highly adept in creating rather rudimentary contraptions and creations, and eventually proposing to the love of his life.\u2003\u2003 But this respite would come to an end after long respected and revered Senior Energy Research Leader Julian Foulke vanished overnight along with his research and lab being completely vacated. Seeing that the entire wing was closed off for investigation, and with the empty lab being cleared for repurposing, Seth decides to use deem it as a new \u201cplayground\u201d to freely test out his new designs. But by random accident Seth manages to unlock a hidden passageway behind the wall leading to a sealed off underground supercomputer room. There Seth manages to activate the recently shut down VEX\u2003observation system, along with its assisting AI who has no recollection of what its job was or any idea what data was gained and stored with the system.\u2003\u2003 Now armed with a means of solving the mystery Seth sets out under the guise of diplomatic meetings and self interest journeys to find out what Foulke was doing and what mystic energy really is. Once he discovers Foulke was doing some rather nefarious and international law violating things, Seth takes on the persona of VEX The Seeker of Truth, naming his new outfit and accompanying helmet with a built in relay to (AI name) and the VEX system. Being masked fuels this untapped egoist and narcissist within Seth, letting him freely take bolder stances and actions on things and allowing him turn his calculated observing habits into theatrical displays of wit and cunning.\u2003\u2003 \u2003Information Name: Seth Kristopher Alden\u2003 Age: 23\u2003 Nationality: Corstaean\u2003\u2003 Ethnicity: Irovell\u2003 Height: 5\u201811\u2019\u2018\u2003 Weight: 187lbs Hair: A medium brown mixed with some darker browns. Parted on one side to give a formal appearance but its left unkept and rather wavy when not out in public.\u2003\u2003 Eye color: Violet\u2003 \u2003Personality\u2003 AS SETH: Seth is rather passive and relaxed in nature. Would rather observe first and then make an informed decision. This gives him an aura of maturity and responsibility despite the small fact that he really doesn\u2019t care to think that way. Its just the right thing to do in his opinion. In times this works against him where he can come off as disinterested or simply not caring at all. When motivated his more excited side shows and he becomes more animated and expressive. This is mostly a result of being conditioned to be formal at a young age.\u2003\u2003 AS VEX: Being masked brings out a more reckless side of Seth. His righteous side gets amplified numerously turning from this advising role into more of a upholder or hero of truth and balance. His actions become a lot more expressive, almost like he\u2019s performing in some grand theatrical piece. He also no longer has to worry about people recognizing his face, letting him get away from speaking how he really feels about people and their actions.

It also appears to be hereditary, as it is exceedingly rare for a person to be the first in their family who has it. Much like mystic matter itself, very little is understood about how attunement works. 1 Effects \u00b6 The only effect of attunement is the unique ability to directly manipulate mystic matter. This begins as an unconscious ability and as such, some people may live their entire lives without ever realizing they have this ability. This was especially common prior to the discovery of mystic matter. What can be accomplished with this ability seems to depend primarily on the individual and how imaginative they are, due to it being a mostly subconscious ability that defies common logic. Typically it is vastly easier for attuned people to learn and practice their ability if they also have alignment , but particularly curious people do just fine without it. It is apparently quite difficult to learn how to utilize this ability at all, with most people aware of their attunement never learning how to accomplish more than very simple feats such as boiling small amounts of water, moving small objects, or creating small currents in air or water. There are, however, virtually no known limitations to this ability, with some fox spirits displaying the ability to transmute a lot of dirt into a little bit of gold, disappear seemingly into thin air, create small trinkets seemingly out of nothing, and other supernatural feats, while the Incarnations display terrifying, godlike amounts of power through attunement. The only known consistent limitation is the creation of living cells, which appears to be practically impossible even for the oldest fox spirits. Only adding to the great difficulty of learning to utilize this ability is that each individual has their own unique understanding of it, and that understanding is typically very abstract and strange, making it incredibly hard to teach and even harder to learn by being taught. Affected groups \u00b6 Fox, Deer , and Crow spirits all possess attunement inherently from birth, along with all Incarnations. Other major spirits are by far the most likely to be born with attunement at approximately one per 1,000 births, while minor spirits have a significantly lower rate of approximately one per 3,000 births. Over 85% of these births have at least one parent that also has attunement. While it is possible for humans to have attunement as well, it is extremely rare at a rate of less than one per 25,000 births in the last 50 years, with virtually all of those births having at least one parent that also has attunement. The rate of humans with attunement has been declining through all of known history, and is currently just under half of what it likely was in the year 500 AO. Cultural reception \u00b6 Treatment of people affected by attunement has varied greatly throughout history depending on the cultures of the time. Some were treated as divine, others treated as demons, some as monsters, and everything in between. After the discovery of mystic matter, attuned people became idolized and now enjoy great popularity.

There is only a single incarnation alive at any given time belonging to each type of major spirit, and none among minor spirits. When one dies, another is born within one year. Incarnations seem to be divided into two groups, mortal and immortal. The power held by each mortal incarnation seems to vary wildly, while the immortal incarnations appear to hold nearly infinite power. A wealth of myths and legends exist claiming to explain the existence of these incarnations, but none have ever been confirmed. Even the Children of the Flame claim to have their own explanation that was supposedly passed down by their gods as divine truth, but while it is known that they have this information, the information itself has not been shared with the public. All that is fully known about the incarnations is that their power is tied directly to mystic matter and appears to defy all logical boundaries, and their lifespans are far longer than average spirits of their respective varieties. Mortal incarnations all adopt the same name sooner or later with each generation, even without outside influence, and bear an uncannily striking resemblance to their predecessors.

It is required for life to be born, but not always required to sustain it, though it does play a vital role in regulating the health of many living things. This is the substance that is perceived by people with Alignment and manipulated by people with Attunement . 1 Being a very recent discovery that defies virtually all prior scientific understanding and is capable of turning the laws of physics upside down, very little is known or understood about mystic matter today. It has proven an incredibly difficult subject of study, as most research conducted to this day has turned out inconclusive, inconsequential, or invalid. The study of mystic matter also struggles with very limited funding and attention, as many scientific organizations have yet to acknowledge its existence as true. Manifestation \u00b6 Mystic matter is comprised of equal parts of subatomic particles and their antiparticles. It is formless, and in all cases observed as of yet, flows through all other matter, in any phase, unimpeded. Rarely it may \u201cpick up\u201d atoms from surrounding matter, which may then be dissolved into particles, carried along harmlessly and intact, or in extremely rare cases - typically in areas where mystic matter is less dense - be mirrored by antiparticles, the most common resulting antimatter from that process likely being antihydrogen atoms. The easiest way to recognize the effects of Mystic matter without alignment is to look at the landscape of Alastor . Each of the three islands has a vastly different concentration of mystic matter flowing through it. The central island of Alexandria has normal levels of mystic matter and looks perfectly natural. The western island, Electra , has extremely low levels of mystic matter causing the landscape to look ravaged, mutated, even eldritch, and crops to be almost entirely unviable, while also reportedly having significant negative effects on the mental health of people who stay there for prolonged periods. The eastern island, Panacea , has extremely high levels of mystic matter causing the landscape to look unnaturally beautiful and crop output to more than triple, and the people who stay there to experience positive effects on their mental health. The animals of these islands can be found subject to the same effects, albeit less severely. There are two leading hypotheses to explain how this matter can exist. One is that dark matter is also part of the composition of mystic matter, and the other is that mystic matter is a universally constant quantum wave function. Both of these concepts are exceedingly difficult to study, however, so they are not well supported or widely pursued. It is also theorized that the effects of the presence of mystic matter on living things vary based on the mental capacity and state of the subjects, and while the theory has been proven in a preliminary study, further study is required. 2 Meta Aside from Alastor, unless it\u2019s specifically noted in the relevant article, the concentration of mystic matter anywhere else in the world is up to you and your ideas. It is also subject to change over time or depending on events, also up to you. History \u00b6 Most matter exists in one of four phases, namely solid, liquid, gas, or plasma. However, a fifth phase was discovered on accident during a study on the effects of introducing different forms of energy to plant matter. What was once thought to simply be a byproduct of some type of matter or \u201csubatomic dust\u201d as some had called it, when examined closer, was found to have a pattern. All attempts to study mystic matter produced nothing meaningful, as researchers could not cause any interaction between the particles and antiparticles leading all tests to produce known normal results. Many researchers dismissed the matter after these results, but a certain few grew obsessive in their search for answers. Eventually, they grew so desperate that they began reaching out to the religious organizations of the world hoping one of them could give them a different perspective from which to approach the problem. They got more than what they bargained for from the Children of the Flame , as they were also researching this phase of matter on their own behind closed doors.

Chiyan people Population approx. 60,000,000 Place of origin Central Sangyon Time of origin Sometime in Era Dira Language Nalamal (Korean) The Chiyan people are one of the seven major ethnic groups of the world , occupying approximately 3% of the global population, primarily in Sangyon on the continent of Avangia . It is also one of the three ethnic and cultural groups that has retained its own prominence to this day since ancient times, even after the ethnogenesis of its numerous subgroups. They speak Nalamal, a distant evolution of the Proto-Chiyanic language, which has yet to be fully reconstructed. The earliest translated artifacts date back to approximately 40 AO, and they describe the challenges of coexisting without a common language, suggesting that some of the ethnic subgroups of the Chiyans may have been present since Era Dira , and may in fact have been more genetically distinct than previously thought. More TBD Chiyan subgroups \u00b6 Meta The places of origin for these subgroups are listed with the current day names of the locations, partially for convenience when looking at the map, mostly because their history is not yet written to have a historical name. When that happens, both will be listed. Sun people \u00b6 Sun people Population TBD Place of origin Tanbaek, Sangyon Time of origin approx. 100 AO Language Nirukti (Thai) The Sun people are the first new ethnic group to be formed from the Chiyan people, migrating south from what is now Dangje to what is now Tanbaek , Sangyon . The ethnogenesis of this group seems to have been caused by lingual differences, as their language, Nirukti, has been found in ancient writings at least as old as the first Chiyan people alongside some of the oldest known Nalamal texts. Taesian people \u00b6 Taesian people Population TBD Place of origin Tanje, Sangyon Time of origin approx. 240 AO Language Talidah (Malay) The Taesian people are the second ethnic group of Chiyan lineage that came to be through the growing regional differences among the first Sun people, migrating south from what is now Tanbaek to what is now Tanje , Sangyon . Their language, Talidah, is a relative of the Sun language, Nirukti, but today only shares a small number of common words. Their language shares some similarity with Y\u00e1hu\u00e0, the language spoken by the Suo people, suggesting frequent cultural exchange despite the distance. Jeonese people \u00b6 Jeonese people Population TBD Place of origin Jeonsan, Sangyon Time of origin approx. 480 AO Language Jalisah (Indonesian) The Jeonese people are the third ethnic group of Chiyan lineage that came to be after the Taesian people settled what is now Jeonsan , Sangyon , and developed their own unique culture around the dense rainforest and tall hills of their new land, in stark contrast to the reliance on the sea found in Tanje . Their language, Jalisah, is a very close relative of the Taesian language, Talidah, and they are generally mutually intelligible. Cheosan people \u00b6 Cheosan people Population TBD Place of origin Cheosu, Sangyon Time of origin approx. 510 AO Language Tiyoma (Filipino) The Cheosan people are the fourth ethnic group of Chiyan lineange that came to be after being pushed to the edges of the mainland by the first Chiyans for speaking a different language, first identifying themselves as a unique culture a century after settling the islands of Cheosu , Sangyon . They seem to have originally spoken Nirukti, but eventually developed into the unique language they speak today.

Cirazan people Population approx. 220,000,000 Place of origin Eastern Destrea Time of origin Sometime in Era Dira The Cirazan people are one of the seven major ethnic groups of the world , occupying approximately 11% of the global population, primarily in Destrea . It is also the most diverse ethnic and cultural group with the largest number of distinct subgroups in the world, the apparent result of being both a nomadic culture and the only ethnic group on the continent of Yulentia for much of early history. The first Cirazan people disappeared less than a century after the establishment of the Alessan Empire , their original culture seeming to have been suppressed to the point of being wiped out by the Alessan people, with very few traces being left behind aside from Alessan records of their enslavement, imprisonment, and execution. Even the original Cirazan language only exists in traces.

When that happens, both will be listed. Alessan people \u00b6 Alessan people Population TBD Place of origin Alessa, Destrea Time of origin approx. 120 AO Language Syrran (Italian) The Alessan people are the first new ethnic group to be formed from the Cirazan people, giving the same name to their first settlement, Alessa , located in what is now Vaceniza , Destrea , which later became the capital of the Alessan Empire . Their language, Syrran, is an evolution of the Common Alessan language, also from which most other languages spoken by Cirazans evolved from. Common Alessan is today considered a dead language, but Syrran is the closest living relative of it. Savorran people \u00b6 Savorran people Population TBD Place of origin Savorra, Destrea Time of origin approx. 170 AO Language Savorran (Spanish) The Savorran people are the second new ethnic group to be formed from the Cirazan people, giving the same name to the land they laid claim to, Savorra , located in what is now Destrea , which later became the Kingdom of Savorra . Their language, Savorran, is an evolution of the Common Alessan language, also from which most other languages spoken by Cirazans evolved from. Common Alessan is today considered a dead language, but Savorran still retains some striking similarity to it. Rovi people \u00b6 Rovi people Population TBD Place of origin Rovillo, Destrea Time of origin approx. 210 AO Language Rovi (Brazilian Portuguese) The Rovi people are the third new ethnic group to be formed from the Cirazan people, giving the same name to the land they laid claim to, Rovillo , located in what is now Destrea . The Rovi language is an evolution of the Common Alessan language, also from which most other languages spoken by Cirazans evolved from. Common Alessan is today considered a dead language, and Rovi retains little similarity to it. Parene people \u00b6 Parene people Population TBD Place of origin Khotka, Grenneria Time of origin approx. 670 AO Language Parovi (Galician) The Parene people are an ethnic group descended from the Rovi people. They had started as groups of naval explorers sent out in many waves, but after enough of them found their way to the same island, they settled the village of Parena , located in what is now Khotka , Grenneria , an island previously uninhabited. They speak Parovi, a dialect of Rovi that developed naturally after their separation from the Rovi people. Taren people \u00b6 Taren people Population TBD Place of origin Tarence, Destrea Time of origin 914 AO Language Alcaran (Mexican Spanish) The Taren people are an ethnic group descended from the Savorran people, formed from a western territory of the Kingdom of Alcaras settled in what is now Tarence , Destrea , that first identified themselves as Taren seven years after the Kingdom of Savorra took over Alcaras. They speak Alcaran, a dialect of Savorran that originated in the Kingdom of Alcaras that is no longer spoken in Alcaras today. Luzian people \u00b6 Luzian people Population TBD Place of origin Selva Luce, Destrea Time of origin 1126 AO Language Luzian (Dominican Spanish) The Luzian people are an ethnic group descended from the Savorran people, originating as a large group of exiled citizens of the Kingdom of Savorra who traveled to the southwestern coast of what is now Destrea , where they claimed their own land bearing the name Selva Luz - known as Selva Luce today - and declared themselves Luzian, seeking independence and fairer, better, more equal lives for themselves. The Luzian language is a dialect of Savorran that developed naturally after their separation from the Savorran people. Tonosian people \u00b6 Tonosian people Population TBD Place of origin Tonosa, Selva Luce, Destrea Time of origin 1237 AO Language Tonosian (Neapolitan) The Tonosian people are an ethnic group descended from the Alessan people, originating as an influx of civilian refugees fleeing the Alessan Empire and seeking refuge in Selva Luz, today known as Selva Luce , Destrea . The Luzian people allowed all of the refugees to stay in the city of Tonosa , and later granted the city independence as the collective identity of the Tonosian people developed under Luzian influence. The Tonosian language is a dialect of Common Alessan that was likely present long before the people first fled to Selva Luz, and has since developed into something uniquely distinct from both Common Alessan, and the modern Syrran language. Corosian people \u00b6 Corosian people Population TBD Place of origin Coroba, Selva Luce, Destrea Time of origin 1244 AO Language Corosian (Sicilian) The Corosian people are an ethnic group descended from the Alessan people, originating as an influx of deserters fleeing the Alessan Empire and seeking refuge in Selva Luz, today known as Selva Luce , Destrea . The Luzian people allowed all of the refugees to stay in the city of Coroba , and later granted the city independence as the collective identity of the Corosian people developed under Luzian influence. The Corosian language is a dialect of Common Alessan that was likely present long before the people first fled to Selva Luz, and has since developed into something quite different both from Common Alessan, and the modern Syrran language. Granazian people \u00b6 Granazian people Population TBD Place of origin Granaza, Selva Luce, Destrea Time of origin 1246 AO Language Granazian (Sardinian) The Granazian people are an ethnic group descended from the Alessan people, originating as an influx of escaped slaves fleeing the Alessan Empire and seeking refuge in Selva Luz, today known as Selva Luce , Destrea . The Luzian people allowed all of the refugees to stay in the city of Granaza , and later granted the city independence as the collective identity of the Granazian people developed under Luzian influence. The Granazian language is thought to be a direct descendant of Cirazan, but after extended influence from Common Alessan, Savorran, Rovi, and other languages spoken by slave owners throughout history, it has become something unique with very little mutual intelligibility with any of those languages, particularly notable for its heavy usage of slang. Southern islanders \u00b6 Southern islanders Population TBD Place of origin Isla Sofia, Ustonia Time of origin 480 AO or earlier Language Various The Southern Islanders are the inhabitants of Isla Sofia , among which exist many additional subcultures and multiple native languages. Due to the practice of oral history and cremation among the Southern Islanders, anthropologists have yet to credibly document their oldest history past the year 480, so while they are considered to be of Cirazan descent today, it is possible that they are truly indigenous to the region and are part of a unique ethnic group. Further complicating the matter is the extensive interference faced by Cirazan, Chiyan , Exilan , and Shisuya colonials throughout history. Eastern islanders \u00b6 Eastern islanders Population TBD Place of origin Nalano Archipelago, Destrea Time of origin 330 AO or earlier Language Various The Eastern Islanders are the inhabitants of the Nalano Archipelago near Destrea , among which exist many additional subcultures and multiple native languages. Due to the practice of oral history and cremation among the Eastern Islanders, anthropologists have yet to credibly document their oldest history past the year 330, so while they are considered to be of Cirazan descent today, it is possible that they are truly indigenous to the region and are part of a unique ethnic group. Further complicating the matter is the immense cultural suppression by the Alessan Empire and their intercontinental slave trade obscuring much of the islanders\u2019 history. First Graven people \u00b6 First Graven people Population TBD Place of origin Lonfolk, Ustonia Time of origin approx. 310 AO Language Various The First Graven people are an ethnic group with numerous subcultures descended from Cirazan nomads that seem to have first settled in what is now Lonfolk , Ustonia . They have kept a comprehensive oral history since ancient times, but no First Graven written material has yet been discovered. They were displaced by Exilan colonials in 1647 and their numbers have dwindled ever since, to the point that much of their history has been lost and their native languages are all considered severely threatened. Native Arkan people \u00b6 Native Arkan people Population TBD Place of origin Arkbay, Ustonia Time of origin approx. 350 AO Language Various The Native Arkan people are an ethnic group with numerous subcultures descended from Cirazan nomads that seem to have first settled in what is now Arkbay , Ustonia . They have kept a comprehensive oral history since ancient times, but no Native Arkan written material has yet been discovered. They were displaced by Exilan colonials in 1643 and have been spread thin throughout the country ever since, so the point that much of their history has been lost and their native languages are all considered severely threatened. Old Oxi people \u00b6 Old Oxi people Population TBD Place of origin Oxbalt, Ustonia Time of origin approx. 370 AO Language Various The Old Oxi people are an ethnic group with numerous subcultures descended from Cirazan nomads that seem to have first settled in what is now Oxbalt , Ustonia . They have kept a comprehensive oral history since ancient times, but no Old Oxi written material has yet been discovered. They were displaced by Exilan colonials in 1639 and their numbers have dwindled ever since, to the point that much of their history has been lost and their native languages are all considered severely threatened.

Here is the abridged version for this page specifically: Carlanders | Inspired by = Celtic nations Mandese | Inspired by = England Allenesian | Inspired by = Germany Oster | Inspired by = Netherlands Vastian | Inspired by = Austria Macan | Inspired by = Belgium Graven | Inspired by = Canada Oxi | Inspired by = Australia Arkan | Inspired by = United States The languages here are listed with their nearest real-world equivalent underneath them. While you can for the most part treat them as 1-to-1 equals, they should still be considered sources of inspiration rather than absolute equivalents, so that we have room to maneuver when making up new stuff. Which you shouldn\u2019t be afraid to do, by the way. This meta note will be removed after enough development has occurred for every initial subgroup (the first nine) to get their own page and be recognizably distinct. Exilan people Population approx. 780,000,000 Place of origin Northern Corstaea Time of origin Sometime in Era Dira The Exilan people are one of the seven major ethnic groups of the world , occupying approximately 39% of the global population, primarily in Ustonia on the continent of Yulentia , and in Corstaea and Osun Tanum on the continent of Ozen . It is also the only ethnic and cultural group in the world that is more populous outside of its native continent, the apparent result of widespread large-scale colonization of Yulentia. The first Exilan people disappeared sometime in the 4th century, merging entirely into the many ethnic groups that came from them, leaving behind almost no trace of their original culture as they do not seem to have kept written records at the time. Among the very few artifacts that clearly symbolize something, however, is a set of climbing tools with the words \u201cprosperity waits beyond the mountain\u201d carved into them, lending further credence to the Irovell and Farodet stories of emerging from the mountain at the beginning of Anno Ortu. More TBD Exilan subgroups \u00b6 Meta The places of origin for these subgroups are listed with the current day names of the locations, partially for convenience when looking at the map, mostly because their history is not yet written to have a historical name. When that happens, both will be listed. Carlanders \u00b6 Carlanders Population TBD Place of origin Carlow, Corstaea Time of origin approx. 45 AO Language Guril\u00e0in, Drul\u00e1in (Scots Gaelic, Irish Gaelic) Carlanders are the first new ethnic group to be formed from the Exilan people, forming their shared identity after migrating to the island known today as Carlow , Corstaea , and are thought to be the most genetically, culturally, and linguistically similar to the original Exilans today due to their long isolation on the island. They are divided primarily into northern and southern subcultures, Guril\u00e0in and Drul\u00e1in, each also being the name of their own distinct languages, both of which still use the same alphabet and many of the same sounds as found in ancient Exilan artifacts from Era Dira , making them two of the most ancient living languages in the world. Some believe that it is possible the Carlanders were alive during Era Dira based on that, or even that they may be the true first Exilans, but no evidence has been found to support these ideas. Mandese people \u00b6 Mandese people Population TBD Place of origin Manden, Corstaea Time of origin approx. 110 AO Language Munait (Old English (futhorc)) The Mandese people are the second new ethnic group to be formed from the Exilan people, first settling in what is now Manden , Corstaea , and seemingly the first among Exilans to develop a unique writing system. While their language, Munait, is very different today, it still uses a very similar alphabet as it did in ancient times, making ancient writings relatively easy to decipher. Allenesian people \u00b6 Allenesian people Population TBD Place of origin Allenthal, Corstaea Time of origin approx. 135 AO Language Harkan (German) The Allenesian people are the third new ethnic group to be formed from the Exilan people, first settling in what is now Allenthal , Corstaea , before being pushed south by Mandese expansionism. Ancient Allenesians spoke Munait, but after regular contact and trade with the Irovell Halli people, their language developed into the amalgam it is today, mutually intelligible with neither of its roots, more similar instead to Oster and Vastian. Oster people \u00b6 Oster people Population TBD Place of origin Osterfeld, Osun Tanum Time of origin approx. 240 AO Language Oster (Dutch) The Oster people are an ethnic group descended from the Allenesian people that developed their unique culture and shared identity after settling in what is now Osterfeld , Osun Tanum , during a mass Allenesian migration to the south caused by Mandese expansionism. The first Oster people spoke Munait, but after regular contact and trade with the Irovell Halli people, their language developed into the amalgam it is today, mutually intelligible with neither of its roots, more similar instead to Munait and Harkan. Vastian people \u00b6 Vastian people Population TBD Place of origin Vastdal, Osun Tanum Time of origin approx. 285 AO Language Vastian (Austrian) The Vastian people are an ethnic group descended from the Allenesian people that developed their unique culture and shared identity after settling in what is now Vastdal , Osun Tanum , during a mass Allenesian migration to the south caused by Mandese expansionism. The first Vastian people spoke Munait, but after regular contact and trade with the Irovell Halli people, their language developed into the amalgam it is today, mutually intelligible with neither of its roots, more similar instead to Harkan and Oster. Macan people \u00b6 Macan people Population TBD Place of origin Macdon, Osun Tanum Time of origin 786 AO Language Various The Macan people are a cultural melting pot, formed from a variety of Mandese, Allenesian, Oster, Vastian, Halli, Svalli, and Kolli peoples, forming their own cohesive shared identity around their common belief that their land of Macdon , located in what is now Osun Tanum , would one day be the center of the world stage. They have no language of their own, instead primarily speaking Halli and often the language of their ancestors as a first and second language. Oxi people \u00b6 Oxi people Population TBD Place of origin Roxware, Oxbalt, Ustonia Time of origin 1639 AO Language Halli (Norwegian) The Oxi people are descended from the Mandese people of Manden , who identified themselves as Oxi after the colonization of Roxware , Oxbalt in 1639, also forcing the name Old Oxi universally onto the many diverse Cirazan natives they displaced. They speak Halli, an Irovell language, due to being forced to learn it to facilitate their journey across the ocean with the help of Halli sailors, as they were not otherwise capable. Thanks to that, the formation of Ustonia has made Halli the world\u2019s most commonly spoken language. Arkan people \u00b6 Arkan people Population TBD Place of origin Centralia, Arkbay, Ustonia Time of origin 1643 AO Language Halli (Norwegian) The Arkan people are descended from the Allenesian people of Hartmond , who identified themselves as Arkan after the colonization of Centralia , Arkbay in 1643, also forcing the name Native Arkans universally onto the many diverse Cirazan natives they displaced. They speak Halli, an Irovell language, due to being forced to learn it to facilitate their journey across the ocean with the help of Halli sailors, as they were not otherwise capable. Thanks to that, the formation of Ustonia has made Halli the world\u2019s most commonly spoken language. Graven people \u00b6 Graven people Population TBD Place of origin Gravenwood, Lonfolk, Ustonia Time of origin 1647 AO Language Halli (Norwegian) The Graven people are descended from the Oster people of Osterfeld , who identified themselves as Graven after the colonization of Gravenwood , Lonfolk in 1647, also forcing the name First Gravens universally onto the many diverse Cirazan natives they displaced. They speak Halli, an Irovell language, due to being forced to learn it to facilitate their journey across the ocean with the help of Halli sailors, as they were not otherwise capable.

Irovell people Population approx. 260,000,000 Place of origin Northern Osun Tanum Time of origin Sometime in Era Dira The Irovell people are one of the seven major ethnic groups of the world , occupying approximately 13% of the global population, primarily in Corstaea and Osun Tanum on the continent of Ozen , as well as Alastor . The first Irovell people disappeared sometime in the 8th century, far removed from and overtaken by the many ethnic groups that came from them, leaving behind swathes of unique myth and lore prized by museums around the world, but little else. The most notable and extensive of myths left behind by the Irovell is the story of their emergence, and the experience of \u201cstepping out from the mountain\u201d in the first years of Anno Ortu.

Extensive Irovell artifacts corroborate the origins of the Tollan people and their relationship to the Irovell, but their time of origin remains unknown. Very few Tollan people remain due to hostile Farodet colonials and later being outnumbered in their own lands by the Amari. They speak Avannarnipi, which is the oldest known living language in the world, and one of only two languages in the world with no known relatives, alongside the Shisuya -Kinu language, Kinugo. It is considered endangered with mostly elderly speakers today. Halli people \u00b6 Halli people Population TBD Place of origin Halstrand, Corstaea Time of origin approx. 330 AO Language Halli (Norwegian) The Halli people are potentially the first new ethnic group to be formed from the Irovell people, first settling in what is now known as Halstrand , Corstaea . Whether the Halli or the Sarians came first is a question still under debate that requires further study. The Halli language is a simplified evolution of the ancient Irovell language, and thanks to how easy it is to learn for the people of Ozen and Yulentia , plus the colonization of Ustonia , Halli has become the world\u2019s most commonly spoken language. Svalli people \u00b6 Svalli people Population TBD Place of origin Sonderg\u00e5rd, Osun Tanum Time of origin approx. 350 AI Language Svalli (Swedish) The Svalli people are the second new ethnic group to be formed by the Irovell people, originally part of the same group that became the Halli, but choosing to separate from them by crossing the Himlav\u00e5rd mountains and settling what is now known as Sonderg\u00e5rd , Osun Tanum . The Svalli language is very similar to Halli as a result. Kolli people \u00b6 Kolli people Population TBD Place of origin Kolg\u00e5rd, Osun Tanum Time of origin approx. 410 AO Language Kolli (Danish) The Kolli people are an ethnic group descended from the Svalli people, originating after a small number of families took issue with the governance of the Svalli people and chose to migrate south, first settling in what is now known as Kolg\u00e5rd , Osun Tanum , attracting more and more Svalli people within decades, eventually identifying themselves as distinct. The Kolli language is very similar to Svalli as a result, but grew more complex over time. Amari people \u00b6 Amari people Population TBD Place of origin Amaransk, Tolred, Corstaea Time of origin approx. 670 AO Language Amari (Finnish) The Amari people are an ethnic group originally descended from the ancient Irovell that chose to separate at the same time as the Halli, migrating north and settling in what is now known as Amaransk , Tolred , Corstaea . They did not at first consider themselves distinctly different people and worked to coexist peacefully with the Tollan people, but after many generations of intermingling both with the Tollan people and with Farodet colonials, their culture developed into something very unique, and the Amari language developed into something more similar to Storran than any modern Irovell language. Jomsson people \u00b6 Jomsson people Population TBD Place of origin Jomsg\u00e5rd, Corstaea Time of origin 1104 AO Language Halli (Norwegian) The Jomsson people are a cultural group descended from the Halli people, formed by traditionalists that rejected the changing beliefs and customs of the Halli, particularly with regard to militarism, choosing to settle the island of Jomsg\u00e5rd for the sake of keeping their traditions alive and continue to keep weapons in their homes. The Jomsson people were both prized and feared around the world for some time for their martial prowess. Sarian people \u00b6 Sarian people Population TBD Place of origin Sarrac, Corstaea Time of origin approx. 205 AO Language Sarian (Faroese) The Sarian people are potentially the first new ethnic group to be formed from the ancient Irovell people that settled the island now known as Sarrac , Corstaea . Whether the Sarians or the Halli came first is a question still under debate that requires further study. The Sarian language is an evolution of the ancient Irovell language, but is not mutually intelligible with other Irovell languages. Alastorri people \u00b6 Alastorri people Population TBD Place of origin Alastor Time of origin 784 AO Language Andar\u01ebdd (Icelandic) The Alastorri people were originally a direct descendant of the ancient Irovell people that may have separated and become nomadic as early as 40 AO, but during their travels to the south, many Halli, Svalli, and Kolli people joined their ranks and brought elements of their cultures with them. In 784 AO, the group settled the central island of Alastor and became known as Alastorri. Today, the Alastorri people are an ethnic and cultural melting pot comprised of spirits from all over the world, and is the only ethnic group with more spirits than humans. They speak Andar\u01ebdd, the closest relative to the ancient Irovell language. It remains similar enough to ancient Irovell that native speakers of Andar\u01ebdd have little difficulty reading text found on ancient Irovell artifacts, but have nearly no mutual intelligibility with other modern Irovell languages.

Shisuya people Population approx. 460,000,000 Place of origin Southern Shinzen Time of origin Sometime in Era Dira Language Suyago (Eastern Japanese) The Shisuya people are one of the seven major ethnic groups of the world , occupying approximately 23% of the global population, primarily in Shinzen on the continent of Avangia . It is also one of the three ethnic and cultural groups that has retained its own prominence to this day since ancient times, even after the ethnogenesis of its numerous subgroups. They speak Suyago, a distant evolution of the ancient Proto-Avanic language, which has yet to be fully reconstructed. The earliest translated artifacts date back to approximately 15 AO, and they document the procedures used to divide the first Shisuya people into five migratory groups, suggesting that the oldest ethnic subgroups of the Shisuya may have been present since Era Dira , and may in fact have been more genetically distinct than previously thought.

The others just aren\u2019t written yet. The other religions aren\u2019t even written at all yet themselves. The circumstances surrounding the formation of the Earth , humans , and spirits are not well understood, and are extremely difficult to study thanks to a thick layer of ash and charcoal beneath the surface of the planet from the end of Era Dira , which has effectively erased nearly all of history from that time period and earlier. Naturally, the religions and ancient cultures of the world have their own stories to explain where we came from. The Common Myth \u00b6 The common myth is named as such due to the fact that it is not only the one believed by the world\u2019s oldest and largest religious group, the Children of the Flame , but also many other cultures around the world, and even some non-religious people to a degree. According to the common myth, the world was created by a singular entity, known only as The Creator, who is depicted as a beautiful woman that later sacrificed herself for the sake of her creations either before or during The End of Everything . There are many variations of the myth, but with a single exception, they all include around this entity and her sacrifice, and most are centered around her. The Account \u00b6 In the year 1854, The Account was published by The Sixth Storyteller of the Children of the Flame. It is missing an unknown amount of its original text and contains redactions throughout. It contains the Storyteller\u2019s retelling of the stories allegedly told to him by the deities Kerosyn the Deliverer, Freya the Deceiver, and Florian the Destroyer at least 200 years ago, whose true names were also first documented there. This detailed variation of the myth claims that rather than a single Creator, it was actually a pair of gods responsible for the creation of the Earth, plus their eight children who all played their own parts in the creation of life and the first cultures. They also claim that one of the gods mentioned within whose name we only know begins with R is the writer behind most of the holy texts of the faith, including several prophecies that have proven true, and more that have yet to manifest. The Fox Variant \u00b6 Fox spirits traditionally believed that The Creator was actually Kerosyn, rather than the unknown woman. There are no further differences in this variation, and it was the only version of the common myth not to include the woman. This belief is considered incorrect and obsolete by most fox spirits today, however, as they later accepted The Account after its publication.

How long the period lasted is unknown, but archaeological discoveries and studies have found evidence of the period extending at least 1000 years into the past prior to the current period. Years are counted negatively from then on, with Era Dira ending in year -1 and Anno Ortu beginning in year 1, with no year 0 between them. The name of the period comes from the discovery that deep underground is a thick layer of ash and charcoal. This layer has been observed across the entire globe, even extending some distance into the oceans, giving us a clear indicator of how far the water level of the Earth has risen since the end of Era Dira. Everywhere it has been observed, it is of the same thickness and apparent age, suggesting that the whole of the planet was at one point on fire for 6 to 8 years in an event now known as The End of Everything . How this fire was caused, or could even be possible, is unknown. With current technology, we are unable to extract meaningful information from the ash layer itself, and all current methods of measuring the age of organic materials show that everything beneath the ash layer appears to be the same age as the ash, leaving us reliant entirely on the discovery of intact artifacts within or underneath it. Effectively, nearly all of Era Dira was erased from history. Evidence that both humans and spirits existed during this period is relatively plentiful, but there have been extremely few discoveries of any form of writing from the period aside from the artifacts held by the Children of the Flame , and the validity of those artifacts is debated. Artifacts in general are extremely rare and difficult to find due to the depth and thickness of the ash layer, but from what has been found, it appears likely that during this period, the spirit population actually outnumbered the human population two to one. The formation of the Earth is assumed by many to have taken place during this period rather than during a separate period of creation , but cannot be confirmed due to how little is truly known about the era, nor has there yet been convincing evidence of how much time the formation of the Earth actually took to complete, let alone when it began, or even when it was completed. While the formation of the Earth is well documented and understood by now, the time it took and the subsequent formation of life is not, and no evidence showing how life may have formed has ever been discovered. For all we know, all life on Earth simply appeared at some point between the end of the Earth\u2019s formation and the year -1000 ED.

The Mistletoe Revolution was a non-violent transition of power in Ustonia that took place between 21/11/1972 and 25/12/1972. Popular anti-war demonstrations all throughout the country included students, young children, elderly dissidents, spirits of many kinds, and even many politicians. The result was the first time the Ustonian people exercised their constitutional right to remove the current president and his party from power with a vote, followed by a forced early election that replaced the militaristic leadership with a peaceful one and marked the beginning of a radical shift in Ustonian policy to rapidly become more progressive. Within the first half of 1973, the newly elected president had successfully negotiated peace with Destrea and Osun Tanum , and returned all annexed territories to them except for Isla Sofia , West Vastdal , and South Macdon , as these territories resisted the return. Ustonia then committed to provide ten years of disaster relief funding to both countries. In the second half of the year, an alliance was formed with Shinzen with the stated goals of both countries being the assurance of lasting peace around the world, their combined overwhelming military forces being a powerful deterrent. Prior to the Mistletoe Revolution, Ustonia had been at war with Destrea and Osun Tanum for over eight years, and had fully occupied over a third of each country.

The intention of the treaty was to ban or strictly regulate civilian access to dangerous weapons to reduce the frequency and severity of violent crime around the world. Every country except Destrea agreed to the treaty. The treaty went into effect in 1975 and all known civilian owned firearms were confiscated by 1980, and all other projectile weapons that were banned under the treaty were confiscated by 1985. No civilians that willingly gave up their weapons were fined or incarcerated during the initial confiscations. Clauses \u00b6 Where civilians previously only needed to register for a permit in their home countries at most to purchase firearms, the requirements have been massively and internationally locked down. Firearms, handguns, and explosive weapons, classified as Category 1 Weapons, are universally banned. Individuals in active service to the military of their government, and individuals who can prove that they are in active service to an active and legitimate private military company in good standing, will not be treated as civilians and are therefore exempt from the ban. Other projectile weapons, such as bows, railguns, and air-powered guns, classified as Category 2 Weapons, are strictly regulated, allowed only to non-civilians, individuals who can prove that they regularly hunt game for food, individuals who live in extremely rural areas who require defense against potentially hostile wildlife, or individuals who can prove that they are employed by an active and legitimate research and development firm in good standing. Also defined in the document are classifications for non-projectile weapons. Category 3 Weapons cover bladed weapons over ten inches in length, all other large lethal weapons, and certain improvised weapons such as baseball bats, hammers, and power tools. Category 4 Weapons cover bladed weapons under ten inches in length, all other small lethal weapons, and certain small weapons such as batons, tonfas, and brass knuckles. Finally, Category 5 Weapons covers all non-lethal weapons. Enforcement \u00b6 Civilians found to be in unlawful possession of Category 2 Weapons are to be faced with a minimum fine of 500,000 CR or equivalent in local currency, or up to a maximum of 30% of their annual income, AND a minimum of one year jail time, or up to five years if they cannot afford the fine. Civilians found to be in unlawful possession of Category 1 Weapons are to be faced with a minimum fine of 2,000,000 CR or equivalent in local currency, or up to a maximum of 65% of their annual income, AND a minimum of five years jail time, or up to thirty years if they cannot afford the fine. These fines are paid to an international trust that is used to fund development of new peaceful technologies for the benefit of all people in the world, provide relief and support to refugees, and support humanitarian non-profit organizations. Individuals found to be in violation of their claimed exemptions after they have expired, been revoked, or otherwise dissolved, are to have their weapons confiscated and destroyed, and if their illegal weapons are Category 1 Weapons, they are also to face the same punishment as civilian possession of Category 2 Weapons. While it is not specified in the treaty, some countries also restrict concealment and regulate ownership of weapon categories 3, 4, and 5 at their own discretion. Fines for these violations are not required to be paid to the international trust, and may instead be collected by local governments. The proliferation of 3D printing technology bringing with it a new problem of untraceable weapons created by people in their own homes was an unforeseen problem and is not addressed by the treaty, so any weapons created in this manner are treated the same as other weapons under the treaty, but local governments have the ability to apply their own specific restrictions, regulations, and penalties for these cases where possible. The untraceability of these weapons makes this task extremely difficult, however. Public reception \u00b6 Public reception was largely positive when this treaty was proposed, notable exceptions being Destrea, who fully opposed the treaty and refused to sign, and both Grenneria and Ustonia , citing high border tensions with Destrea as a concern, though they ultimately did sign as it became clear that national militaries and private military companies were exempt. Part of the reason reception was so positive and the proposal was so easy to pass compared to other international treaties is that at the time, civilian owned firearms were rare in most of the world, and virtually unheard of in some areas. Ustonia and Destrea accounted for more than 80% of all civilain owned firearms in the world, with Grenneria accounting for the next 8%. As the legal proceedings carried on, it was also made public that the proposal included total restriction of non-projectile weapons, which led to public outcry in many countries and caused these restrictions to be heavily relaxed.

The Reclamation War is an ongoing conflict between Destrea , Ustonia , and Shinzen that began in 1980. It halted temporarily between 1991 and 1998 due to The Big Event crippling Destrea, after which it began again with a surprise attack on the Ustonian capital of Northfair utilizing stolen Nagase aircraft from Shinzen. After the 1972 Ustonian Mistletoe Revolution took place and Destrea\u2019s territory was returned, the states of Prestona and Verace independently defected to Ustonia in 1973, which was quickly followed by an overwhelming military force being stationed on their borders. Destrea spent the next seven years building their case against Ustonia while preparing their military for a full scale invasion, ultimately declaring war claiming that not only were Prestona and Verace rightfully theirs, but all of the land of Yulentia rightfully belonged to Destrea. After The Big Event took place in 1991 and the Destrean chain of command and power structure was destroyed by the Risky Witches , the Reclamation War halted as the country struggled with civil war and the Risky Witches while rebuilding its government. During this time, large numbers of covert operatives were spread out all over the world without orders. These operatives spread propaganda, incite civil unrest, steal national secrets and technology, and more, and are still believed to be active today. In 1998, Destrean operatives in Shinzen revealed the fruits of their labor: Stolen advanced aircraft prototypes from Nagase, each of which was capable of single-handedly overwhelming both Ustonian and Shinzenese air force squadrons and proved to be nigh untouchable during their surprise attack on Northfair. This brought Shinzen into the conflict and turned the tables almost instantly. At the same time, the Risky Witches came into the possession of one additional stolen Nagase aircraft prototype, along with its pilot, a Shinzenese air force test pilot that discovered the Destrean plan and tried to stop it in any way she could. With the assistance of this pilot and her prototype aircraft, the Risky Witches joined the Reclamation War for a short time and dealt consecutive decisive blows to Destrea, destroying each and every one of the prototype advanced aircraft, then exited the conflict.

(external link) Transcription CHILDREN OF THE FLAME SEEKERS COMPENDIUM THE GODS\u2019 RECTIFICATION \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 THE FOLLOWING RECORD IS DIRECTLY FROM THE STORYTELLER Fellow believers, you need not be a scholar to know that we are not the first to inhabit the world. We are in fact, the second. As recorded in our codex, those before us had a history at least double the length that ours is today, and they were lost in the event we know as \u201cThe Inferno\u201d as a result of their sins. You also know that event was carried out by our three gods known as the Deliverer, the Destroyer, and the Deceiver. Scholars among us have known throughout history that our gods are not mysterious otherworldly beings, but rather humanoid creatures who inhabit the world much like we do. For all my life, I have yearned to meet our gods in the flesh so that I may learn more about them, but as many of you know, only one of the three has been willing to show himself to me. It is with great excitement I write to you today, for I can finally say this is no longer the case. On the sixth of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, our three gods came to me to discuss the truth. As it turns out, much of our knowledge has been wrong all this time, and much more was simply missing. For instance, none of us have ever known the true names of our gods! Our Destroyer, whose true name is Florian, informed me that it took much convincing to get the Deceiver, Freya, and the Deliverer, Kerosyn, to visit me due to the sordid and despicable actions of my predecessors. Apparently, the two of them are quite playful and easygoing, and they prefer to keep unpleasant things at a distance. I do not yet know if they have changed their opinion of me or our organization, but I will not complain or beg, and I expect all of you to do the same. But despite their hesitance, they were very forthcoming with information and happy to correct our errors. From the Beginning to the End of Everything we have all new perspective, and we now know the true origins of our gods, for which I am infinitely grateful. In the beginning, our three gods were yet to be born. In their place were a pair responsible for the creation of the world, and after them came eight children, all holding power over a different area of creation. These children were the ones responsible for the creation of humanity, the spirit people, the cycle of life, and nearly everything surrounding those things. They quickly fell victim to sin and formed their own factions, unable to agree on what is right and wrong, ushering in one of several eras of war while the original two gods remained silent. One of the children, called R\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, withdrew from the world and spent her life recording not only history and events, but prophecies of what is yet to come, and it is these writings that fill our codex, and is the source of this information recounted by Freya. It was thousands of years of war and conflict before our gods were born, during which another three children were born too weak to hold power over creation, but still far higher than humanity could ever dream of reaching. One of these children was the infamous M\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588n responsible for many atrocities against humanity and frequently credited as the primary role model of the Second Storyteller. The warring had spread to the gods themselves and their fighting would have cataclysmic effects on the world, dramatically reshaping it. Humanity was culled to merely a fraction of what it once was, all but one of the children was killed by the one called \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, who we know as \u201cThe False One,\u201d leaving only him and one of the two original gods, and only during this time were our three gods born. Shockingly, they were not born as such, but rather as lowly people to regular parents just as all of us! According to Freya, the remaining two gods were growing tired of the power struggle and devised a type of game to decide who among them would take final control of the world. Freya was chosen by \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 as one of six \u201cscouts,\u201d given certain godlike powers and sent to choose one spirit each. These chosen few would receive the souls and powers of some of the deceased gods, then the scouts would be responsible for training their abilities to use their powers before escorting them to a grand tournament through which the winner would challenge \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 for the throne of the world. Freya\u2019s journey was to find one of the fox people, eventually leading her to Kerosyn. Kerosyn retains no memories from before he took on his current form. He was not born with his brilliant ethereal visage, but rather as a regular, lowly fox spirit. Fortunately, during this time in his life he regularly kept a journal, which Freya holds today and read to me. Kerosyn had a harsh upbringing, never knowing his parents and unfortunately growing up during a time of great prejudice against his kind with their reputation as tricksters. He would wander from place to place searching for someone to accept him, but would always be met either by immediate hatred or a short friendship and betrayal, yet he would somehow manage to wear a smile through the wake it all. Against all odds, he writes that one day a small group of human children found him in the woods and invited him to play a game with them, making great friends with all of them. The children brought him to their home village and while the adults met him with suspicion and fear, they listened to their children and allowed him to stay. He writes that night in a rare display of contemplation that he worries about what the adults will tell their children, how long their tolerance of him will last, and even wondering what his own parents were like. After a long period with no journal entries, he writes that he\u2019s got butterflies in his stomach. For the first time, a human village has truly accepted him, and their trust in him has grown so much that they are trusting him with an important job. This village is one of the few rural settlements that survived the many wars of the gods, but not without suffering heavy damage that has left them with no tools and failing farms, causing them to rely on traveling by foot to faraway villages to trade for food. This time, Kerosyn was sent to trade. Much like a child, he writes many fantasies of what he might see in this new village, what their food might taste like among other things. His next entry is distinctly more hollow as he expresses nervousness regarding how he may be treated by the strangers, fearing that he may fail the mission. Later, he writes that his fears were confirmed as the strangers surrounded and interrogated him, even throwing stones and tools at him, but he still managed to get the food he came for. He writes that he feels terrible about what happened and can\u2019t shake the feeling of dread, like everything is beginning to fall apart. Freya arrived just outside a rural village believing that her target would be there. She describes the terrible feeling she had at that moment which led her to remain on the outskirts of the village, eventually noticing that a group of brigands were beginning a raid. While she may have been able to prevent the raid, she decided to sit and watch, hoping that her target would show promise by stopping the raid themselves. The pillaging would continue for hours with no sign of her target, the inhabitants being murdered one by one and their homes and fields being set aflame, but she continued to wait and watch it burn. Later, she says, a tiny little loser came rushing out of the forest towards the burning village, and she thought that this couldn\u2019t possibly be her target. He ran into the village and slowly froze, realizing that all the people were dead. The brigands had not yet left by this point and had noticed him standing there, and as they began to move towards him, he started to step back and fell over. Frantically, he scrambled to his feet and began to run away as the brigands gave chase while Freya continued to watch, hoping he does something interesting. They threw a spear at him which pierced his leg and pinned him to the ground, and she describes in great detail the beating he received, his cries, and other things I have chosen to omit. Ultimately he is stabbed through the chest and left to bleed out. Once the brigands were gone, she approached the \u201ctiny little loser\u201d and, by her description, she felt something impossible to explain and knew he was her target. She prodded his side to confirm he wasn\u2019t dead before kicking him over onto his back and tried to explain who she was and tempt him with power, but he didn\u2019t seem to hear her, so she tried using hand gestures to ask if he wanted to live. All he could say was \u201csorry\u201d as his breathing stopped. She then opened the bag given to her at the start of her journey and from inside came a white butterfly, which fluttered over to the dead boy and landed on his forehead. Slowly, he was engulfed in ethereal white flames until, as she describes, his body suddenly jerked to life as he began to writhe and scream in pain, but just as suddenly as it started, it was over. He went silent as the flames dissipated revealing his new form as we know him today, the butterfly now fluttering around him. Kerosyn retains memory from this point on, and he describes jumping to his feet and being bewildered from how light he felt. He spent a while getting accustomed to his new body while, in his words, \u201csome weird kitty lady was there.\u201d He says she started to run off and asked him to follow her, so he figured it would be fun to run around and did as she said. They ran faster and faster until, in his words, \u201cit was ultra fast, I could hardly see\u201d until they arrived in a small clearing, where she slowed down and tripped him. She tried to explain what just happened and what his responsibility is, but according to Freya, he grew visibly bored and restless, insisting that he doesn\u2019t care and just wants to run some more, so she gave up and they took off again, eventually ending up at a beautiful pond deep in the forest that captivated Kerosyn. Freya was feeling mischievous and kicked Kerosyn into the water, saying he needs to grow up a bit and learn his strength. She punched him in the stomach and taunted him, trying to get him to fight back so she could do her job. It gets to him quickly and he begins throwing wild punches which she easily ignores, taunting him for his apparent lack of skill. According to Kerosyn, something changed and his thoughts started slowing down, becoming more and more focused, then his memory blanks out for a moment. Freya fills in the blank, saying in that moment his punches quickly shifted from wild to precise, as if he jumped from a total novice to an expert in the blink of an eye. She says he then took a step back and changed his stance taking on a completely different fighting style and his attacks became engulfed in flame, creating a mesmerizing display something like a ribbon dance. She could barely keep up with him and shifted to defense, to which he responded with an immense kick to her stomach sending her hurtling into a tree and knocking the wind out of her, but for some reason he appeared frozen in place after that. Kerosyn chimes in again, describing that the blank spot in his memory ends there. He asked her if she was okay and helped her to her feet, and after she dusted herself off expressing that she\u2019s fine, he excitedly asked if they could go running again. Freya says that she lost all doubts about Kerosyn at that moment, laughed it off and took off running through the forest with him once again. As they ran, the scent of smoke permeated the air and caused Kerosyn\u2019s mood to change from playful to vengeful as he changed course to hunt down the source. Bursting out of the forest with uncanny composure, he began searching for survivors in the new burning village they had encountered. The dead lined the paths, but a couple of children were found still alive. While bringing them to safety, Kerosyn caught sight of the brigands responsible and felt compelled to punish them. He raised a wall of flame between himself and Freya, who he told to take the children to safety herself, and this display of power scared the brigands into running. He did not allow them to escape and continuously cut them off with walls of flame, eventually trapping them in a ring of flame with him. Kerosyn grew visibly uncomfortable while explaining this to me and Freya took over for him, saying that he had lost control of himself in that moment, and the only thing that prevented him from killing them was the presence of children. The ring of flame dissipated and he appeared frozen once again as the brigands escaped. She asked him what he was doing, to which he responded with \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d and took off running after the brigands, leaving a trail of fire behind him. By the time she had gotten the children to a safe place and caught up with him, the bodies of the brigands were lying beaten to death as Kerosyn was pacing anxiously, but when she called to him, he took off running again until they made their way to the brigands\u2019 encampment. At this point, Kerosyn had covered his ears apparently unwilling to relive this time in his life, truly a gentle soul. Freya continues, saying that he surrounded the entire encampment in a towering ring of fire and made his way down to the center, where he then engulfed every single building in flames all at once, leaving the people in a state of shock and awe. As they panicked, he began to viciously pick them off, which quickly devolved into total animalistic slaughter. After it was over, Kerosyn was once again frozen in place, fallen to his knees. He explained to her that he couldn\u2019t control himself and this isn\u2019t what he wanted, that he felt wrong, and even though the people he attacked were not good people, still didn\u2019t deserve this. She responded by ensuring him that\u2019s why she\u2019s here, to prevent this from ever happening again. Freya gestures for Kerosyn to uncover his ears before continuing, saying that not a lot happened over the next several years, but Florian takes over for the first time. He explains that he had been watching the two of them ever since \u201cthat fateful day\u201d and that what happened in that time is important in its own way. Rather than trying to train for fights or to control their powers, they simply wandered aimlessly throughout the land having a good time and deepening their relationship. They built a reputation as goodhearted pranksters, doing good deeds and getting into harmless mischief whilst Kerosyn practiced self control throughout. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s tournament was fast approaching though, and Florian knew it. As the son of M\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588n, Florian was never associated with orders of the gods, instead being taught that they are evil and the world is not worth saving so long as they remain. He learned to work from the shadows and to always gather as much knowledge as possible before taking any kind of action. He witnessed his mother be critically wounded in the crossfire of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s petty war and resolved to return the favor, but was too careless in his actions which were mistakenly attributed to his mother, who was then killed by \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 in retaliation, leading Florian to swear vengeance against the gods. He watched \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 for years, keeping careful track of his movements and plans, learning all about the tournament in the process and eventually setting out to study the participants. After learning all he needed to know of the six participants, he approached the one he thought most likely to win, Kerosyn, and shared his knowledge with him and Freya. He had begun to explain what the tournament is for but was surprised to see Freya already knew all about it, as she spent her life first in servitude to the gods and later, after confiding in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and receiving her blessing, in hiding with M\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588a, daughter of R\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, where she learned all about the tournament and helped devise a strategy to sabotage \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s plan. Both of them realized that the scales were tipping into their favor as the puzzle pieces fell together on their own and began explaining the situation to a very confused Kerosyn, who was quick to understand and remained confident. Florian joined their journey from here on out and offered his services to them as a friend with a common enemy. Florian describes to me the opponents Kerosyn faced in the tournament as a peace-loving deer person, a knowledge-seeking mouse person, a valiant wolf person, a merciless shark person, and a wise lizard person, all traits of the gods their souls were inherited from. According to him, there is always one incarnation of each in this world at any given time. Even though they may die physically, the souls of gods remain too powerful to disappear forever, even against him. Before Florian got the chance to continue his account, Kerosyn once again covered his ears. When the three arrived where the tournament was being held, Freya was taken away by Florian and restrained with the other scouts still living as \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 explained the rules to the chosen six. All fights were to end in death, and failure to kill was also to result in death. If one of the losers brought their scout with them, the scout dies with them. The last one standing would fight \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 himself, the ultimate winner receiving absolute power over all. Up first, Kerosyn and the deer. Over as quickly as it started, the deer simply forfeited and took his own life, unnerving Kerosyn. Next, Kerosyn faced the mouse where exactly the same thing happened, and Florian killed the scout. This visibly hurt Kerosyn making him frantic, leading his fight with the wolf to turn in his favor. He became frenzied by the taste of blood and viciously tore apart his final opponents, even becoming sadistic and outright frightening according to Freya and Florian, but when \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 attempted to kill him from behind, in that split second Kerosyn completely changed his demeanor, much like when he first sparred with Freya by her description. It was a display of absolute superiority by Kerosyn, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 completely unable to touch him, though Kerosyn couldn\u2019t find an opening either. Florian and Freya began to taunt \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 from the sidelines until finally, he turned his attention to them, fatally stabbing both of them at once. Kerosyn, his ears still covered, then tells me he took that chance to grab \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 by the spine and immolate him from the inside out. He laughed maniacally as he lay burning, claiming that Kerosyn may have won the fight but he can\u2019t lose in the end. Unbeknownst to anyone, he had secretly infused his soul with a curse of pestilence, released upon the world through his death. Kerosyn uncovers his ears. Our eyes all fixate on Kerosyn, looking strangely serene. Florian tells me that he has never heard this part of the story before, and Freya jokes that it\u2019s because they were dead at the time. Kerosyn continues, saying he was devastated and felt like he had lost everything. The last remaining god said he had won and he is free to do whatever he sees fit, and in response, he picks up Freya\u2019s body and walks away. He gave her a proper burial underneath a weeping cherry tree and sat with her for a day, then takes off wandering aimlessly through the dying world. Disappointed by how short Kerosyn\u2019s story was, Florian continues his account saying that he was resurrected by the last god, the process being particularly gruesome and traumatic for him, his body writhing and transforming into the form we know today, now containing the souls of both M\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588n and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. He says that he immediately knew the situation upon regaining consciousness, and he and the last god went together to Freya\u2019s grave. The last god gave Florian a chance to lament Freya\u2019s suffering before beginning her resurrection, during which she simply burst out of the ground as she was. According to Freya, she simply felt as though she woke up, but she too seemed to know exactly what was going on and what would happen next. The three of them then began their search for Kerosyn to seal the fate of the world. Kerosyn continues, saying that he was very happy to see his friends again when they found him, and as soon as the last god asked if he was ready, he knew what to do. The last god had no need to give them any instructions, so she simply bestowed the three of them with equal portions of her power and ceased to be. Kerosyn gave Freya and Florian a short time to complete their tasks and made his way to where he needed to be. Freya and Florian ran around the dying world and selected small groups of humans and spirit people who had yet to be affected by the curse of pestilence and returned to Kerosyn. He then delivered a great speech wise beyond his disposition to the people (which he refused to repeat to me) and instructed them to stay in that one spot, and have no fear. Kerosyn, Freya and Florian then traveled to a high cliff from which they could see all the land, and Kerosyn with a furious, yet melancholic scream, bathed all the world in flame, sparing only those who heeded his warning. I could hardly believe what I was hearing at times during this recounting. How could we have been so wrong about so many things? How could we claim to be the only ones enlightened by the truth when our beliefs were based in lies? Not only were our three gods born to lowly flesh, but they have all experienced death and rebirth. They are not the creators of our world, nor do our previous names for them apply, they are our saviors. They do not even possess the magnitude of power we once thought, needing to combine their strength if they are to accomplish feats of creation. They are in fact more akin to ghosts than gods, and my respect for them has only deepened with this knowledge. Together, they are our messiahs, but apart, they are simply immortals who have each experienced unimaginable hardship and suffering. In addition, we have learned that before them, there was not simply one creator, but rather thirteen! And incarnations of some of them still walk this world! My gratitude cannot be expressed in a lifetime, and as if this amazing knowledge wasn\u2019t enough, I was told in passing by Florian that one of the original gods is still living in this world herself, and she holds all of R\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s texts in her grand library, but she is (the pages are torn here) Truly, there is no way I, as a mere flesh and blood mortal, can repay this blessing of knowledge from our three saviors. However, closing our meeting, I also learned that they do not expect to be repaid for any good deeds. Not necessarily out of the goodness of their hearts, but because of what has been prophesied. The texts of R\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 have been one hundred percent accurate since they were written, so I fully believe what I have been told is correct. The End of Everything was not destined to happen once, but several times. Our world will not last forever, and we will fall just as our predecessors did. But, do not fear! Humanity continues to exist because of a chosen few, and I believe that we are that chosen few of this era. So long as we continue to act in favor of our saviors, we will be spared in the End of Everything. Along with this account, he wrote about the gods themselves more recently.

(1.5 m) WEIGHT: 20 lbs (9 kg) BUILD: Slim, androgynous HAIR COLOR: N/A EYE COLOR: N/A COMPLEXION: N/A SEX: N/A STATUS: UNKNOWN REMARKS: Despite his physical appearance and the fact that one can physically touch him, his whole body is non-corporeal. It appears to be made of flames, though he is cold to the touch and does not spread fire. The size, brightness, and intensity of the flames appear to change in response to his mood. Small wisps of the same white flames are kicked up where he steps. They too are cold and do not spread fire. If one tries to shove him, one will be met with the expected amount of resistance for an average human despite his form and weight. He admits that his body contains most of a human skeleton. It is likely that he always returns to his normal form due to that skeleton, despite his non-corporeality allowing him the ability to freely alter his physical form. A small white butterfly follows him wherever he goes, never more than a few feet away. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: His personality is very reminiscent of an innocent, fidgety child, even in highly inappropriate situations. He makes up for his lack of expressive eyes with highly expressive and animated body language, particularly with his ears and tails. Curiously, he maintains his happy demeanor even when he is absolutely not happy, sometimes even giggling when one would expect him to cry. It takes a lot to get him to express more than subtle hints of any other emotion. His attention span is quite short unless his interest has been piqued. He is overflowing with charisma and confidence, completely oblivious to just how much he stands out and how others may feel about that. He has a penchant for playing pranks. As a result of all of this, he gets along very well with children. He is very eager to learn anything and everything, constantly looking for new experiences, but makes a horrible student as he gets distracted very easily and is always goofing off. As such, despite his very wide skill set, he will probably never truly master anything. He is quite creatively talented, very fond of physical sports and games, and particularly enjoys anything to do with food, from agriculture to the culinary arts. His curiosity knows no bounds, and his naivete makes him very quick to trust and easy to fool. He also tends to pick up on many trends among the youth and run them into the ground.

(1.9 m) WEIGHT: 214 lbs (97 kg) BUILD: Slender, toned, athletic HAIR COLOR: BLACK, WHITE TIPS EYE COLOR: YELLOW, VERTICAL PUPILS COMPLEXION: DARK BROWN SEX: FEMALE STATUS: DEPLOYED W/ UNKNOWN MERCENARIES REMARKS: Aside from her height, her body hides more than it shows. While she clearly appears somewhat muscular, the real extent of her muscle mass is much more than meets the eye, as shown by her weight. Her eyes have wrinkles and bags under them due to a lack of sleep. By her own word, she is simply incapable of sleeping. Her fingernails are long and slightly pointed, but curiously capable of extending and taking the form of claws at will. She has remarkable control over her two cat tails, even able to pick up and hold many objects. Four blue flame wisps float around her, but are rarely seen as they do not appear on film and only appear to the naked eye when she allows them to. The symbol she refers to as \u201cthe brand\u201d is burned onto her back and glows white with a red outline, just bright enough to shine through one layer of clothing. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: Her personality is fierce and flirtatious, almost always striking something between arrogance and seduction in her body language. She is very expressive, almost always smiling and rarely seen with relaxed eyes. Bursting with confidence, charisma and charm, she can nonchalantly talk her way into, out of, or around just about anything while humiliating others in the process. She has not an ounce of shame or shyness, is very good at catching eyes and is no stranger to using her body to get her way. When words or wiles fail, she is not afraid to resort to violence. With her incredible strength, dexterity and reflexes, it almost never fails, and can get incredibly cruel and humiliating. She is very aware of her ego, so while she enjoys toying with people and thinks very little of most, she will show great respect to anyone with the self-assurance to stand up to her. She has a penchant for flashy theatrics and bravado, often making a show out of innocuous interactions and drawing things out. Particularly interested in guns, motorcycles, and metalworking. Her marksmanship is second to none. By her own admission, she constantly craves indulgence, be it innocent, sexual, violent, or any mixture of those things, and tends to give into her temptations much easier when bored. She gets bored very easily. Underneath the rough exterior, she is genuinely warm and compassionate. (external link) Transcription NAME: FLORIAN AGE: \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 HEIGHT: 7 ft. 2 in. (2.18 m) WEIGHT: 344 lbs (156 kg) BUILD: Extremely lanky HAIR COLOR: BLACK EYE COLOR: YELLOW, BLACK SCLERA COMPLEXION: PALLID, GHOSTLY SEX: MALE STATUS: RESEARCHING BIOSCIENCE REMARKS: Even for his height, he is far heavier than he looks. Defying all expectation, his muscles and bones are incredibly dense, explaining his weight and making him exceptionally strong and durable. His arms are covered in black feathers, and his hands seem to be made entirely of said feathers. Also against any expectation, not only do his feathered hands still function, able to grasp and lift things, but they can also become quite stiff and sharp, able to cut and stab through most things. His arms are constantly emitting an unusual, wispy black smoke, and he appears to be able to control the flow and consistency of it, but cannot stop it. The skin around his eyes is severely burned to the point that the skin is gone. His gait is very strange due to his proportions, but he moves with a deliberate elegance that somehow only makes it stranger. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: His personality can only be described as that of an old fashioned evangelist. He carries himself with a strict, antiquated grace that only makes him look off-putting, even when alone. Also, he maintains a quiet and restrained voice at all times until there is a clear need to speak up, or he gets a bit too frustrated or passionate. His expressions and body language are over the top, his resting facial expression is a crazed grin, and his laugh is unfortunately devilish. Has a tendency to mutter a lot, and talks to crows, plants, books, and himself. His ego is massive and he is very susceptible to flattery and praise. Due to spending most of his time in isolation, he is quite awkward and lacks communication skills, except with topics he is passionate about, especially when he is in a position of leadership. He admits that when he tries making quick comebacks, it always backfires. Beyond his faith, his primary interests are bioscience and military strategy and tactics, and his knowledge on all of these things is second to none. He has a serious superiority complex. Underneath the surface, he has a big heart, which you can observe through his subtle actions such as carefully avoiding flowers and insects where he walks. Over the years, folklore has personified him as death itself. He took that to heart and feels responsible for the deaths of many, fueling his studies. Beside these records, the falsified version of The Inferno is also stored. (external link) Transcription CHILDREN OF THE FLAME CARDINAL RECORDS HOLY RECTIFICATION SERMON THE FOLLOWING SERMON WAS ORDERED BY THE HIGH CARDINAL Fellow believers, you need not be a scholar to know that we are not the first to inhabit the world. We are in fact, the second. As recorded in our codex, those before us had a history at least double the length that ours is today, and they were lost in the event we know as \u201cThe Inferno\u201d as a result of their sins. You also know that the event was carried out by our three gods known as the Deliverer, the Destroyer, and the Deceiver. Scholars among us have known throughout history that our gods are not mysterious otherworldly beings, but rather humanoid creatures who inhabit the world much like we do. I come to you today bearing the gift of amazing knowledge, for our gods have chosen to grace our great Storyteller with their presence and bestowed upon him their story, filling in the gaps of our codex once and for all! Please, join me in prayer so that I may deliver this great gift to you. As you know, in the Beginning, there was only the Creator. She created the world and all life that inhabited it. Humanity, her children, quickly fell into sin and corruption, and from among them rose the False One, and the one whose name shan\u2019t be spoken. The two of them were locked in several great wars for thousands of years, bringing the world to ruin. The Creator grew tired of this insolence and raised up the Deliverer, the Destroyer, and the Deceiver to stand up against them. During the ensuing Reckoning, the world was victim to such ruin that humanity was reduced to a mere fraction of what it once was. But, my fellow Children, until this blessed day, our understanding of the events of the Inferno have been merely partial! Rejoice, and allow me to read to you, courtesy of our gods, the one true account of the events of the Inferno, in full! And in the end times, the false one bore control of the world and was to marshal it to ruination, yet the destroyer stood up to the false one and engaged him in war. They fought for a thousand years bringing perpetual wink and woe to all those around them, till one day appeared the deceiver, whom tricked them into believing neither one was content to battle any longer, and mocked the men into worshiping her as the one righteous god for a thousand years. And in the two thousandth year, the deliverer stood up and denounced those men for their sins, and he demonstrated his righteousness by taking the heart of the false one and burning him towards the pyre, from which the flames spread across all of the of the world, and the destroyer known his righteous bid and was sent to amerce those men of sin, while those men whom saw the righteousness of the deliverer and pledged themselves to him were spared, among them, the deceiver prostrated herself and declared herself to be reformed. And towards the day of the solar eclipse, the deliverer granted a righteous speech to those men whom pledged to him, and bestowed upon them the code to live by, lest the destroyer amerce their sins, and then he rose up and the entirety of the world was bathed in his holy flame, born anew from the ashes, our home. Truly, fellow Children, we are blessed beyond compare. Our order of the Most Holy Flame, gifted with such divine glory, is now undoubtedly the One True Order, and all those of you whom submit yourselves to The Holy Baptism and remain clean of sin are most assured to be saved from death and wrongdoing. Glory be!

It lasted only two days, and saw the assassinations of all high ranking Destrean officials, politicians, and military officers who supported the regime, the total domination and occupation of the province of Espada , and the start of a yet ongoing Destrean civil war led by a newly empowered generation of revolutionaries. Beginning in late 1990, the yet-to-be-named Risky Witches mobilized elite forces to key locations all over the country under orders to closely monitor Destrean officials and officers in the area and be prepared to attack at a moment\u2019s notice. With an effective force of nearly 8,000 deployed rebels, the group successfully placed the entirety of the Destrean government under surveillance, and they remained undetected due to the general public also being suspicious of the regime at the time thanks to sharply dropping approval rates caused by the recent national order to execute any spirits showing \u201csigns of rebellion\u201d without trial. At the turn of the new year in 1991, the moment the holiday fireworks started, the Risky Witches launched their attack simultaneously across the nation. News broadcasters covering the fireworks in these areas were hijacked by the group and used to broadcast their attacks nationwide. All government officials and military officers anywhere within the country with any positive connection to the Destrean regime were assassinated in only 39 minutes, entirely destroying the Destrean chain of command. The most notable attack during this time was a large scale operation to raid the personal villa of the Destrean commander in chief, led by Freya , supported by 31 masked rebels, and with a hostage news crew in tow that was forced to broadcast the operation. The group stormed the villa with frightening efficiency, pushing their way past the elite guard units assigned to protect the commander in chief so easily that many people watching the broadcast did not believe it was real. After reaching the commander in chief and shooting his bodyguards through the wall, Freya kicked down his door and upon walking in, was shot eight times in the chest and twice in the head, but remained standing, shot the commander in chief once in the throat, and walked out of frame. In this moment, the news crew was turned to the 31 masked rebels, who removed their masks and revealed that they were all spirits. One of these spirits then ensured viewers that everything they had seen was real, declared the establishment of the Risky Witches and delivered their agenda , delivered a rallying speech to any aspiring rebels, delivered a warning for all citizens of Espada to stay indoors, lock and cover their doors and windows, and to avoid answering the door for any reason until further notice, and finally, urged all citizens living in or around the fortified city now known as Presidia de la Bruja to evacuate within the next hour, declaring that the Risky Witches intended to invade the province and take it for themselves. After closing the speech by ensuring the Destrean people that the group means them no harm, and hinting at the fact that the group had killed zero innocent civilians during this insurrection, the broadcast was cut and the news crew was escorted to safety. This broadcast successfully empowered a large number of prospective rebels and revolutionaries throughout the nation, many of whom took up arms against Destrean police in the same moment. As more and more people learned that the Risky Witches truly did not kill any innocents, the fervor of the rebellion surged, even more so as every rebel killed was then seen as a martyr. With a destroyed chain of command and many elite forces wiped out, this new rebellion dealt further significant damage to Destrea and found it easier than expected to arm themselves, marking the beginning of a new civil war that rages on to this day. Over the next two days, the Risky Witches converged on the province of Espada at full strength, which included a modest air force comprised of stolen Destrean aircraft, wiping out every last remnant of Destrean forces stationed within it. After establishing themselves within Presidia de la Bruja, they declared themselves the Revolutionary State of Espada and celebrations erupted for days on end, uninterrupted due to Destrea lacking the forces to fight back thanks to the revolutionaries outside of Espada carrying on their fights, pushing back on all fronts, as the Risky Witches assured citizens of Espada they were safe now and would be kept safe by the group, free from Destrean regime. By the time a new Destrean regime was formed by militant conservatives and nationalists, Espada was fully fortified and well armed, which marked the beginning of the ongoing war between Destrea and Espada. Broadcasting the attacks on national news proved to be beneficial for the Risky Witches, as it made it plainly easy for all to see exactly how the Destrean regime treated its people, and that the Risky Witches had not lied when claiming to have never killed an innocent civilian, which was hugely beneficial towards both goals of empowering the masses to revolt and quickly establishing international diplomatic relations.

The other religions aren\u2019t even written at all yet themselves. Deep beneath the surface of the Earth is a thick layer of ash and charcoal that extends even some distance beyond ocean shores, suggesting that the whole of the planet was on fire for a period of 6 to 8 years. With current technology, we are unable to extract meaningful information from the ash layer itself, and all current methods of measuring the age of organic materials show that everything beneath the\u2003ash layer\u2003appears to be the same age as the\u2003ash, leaving us reliant entirely on the discovery of intact artifacts within or underneath it to learn about the period. Effectively, nearly all of Era Dira was erased from history. How this fire could have happened has yet to be explained by any credible scientific theory, and by all counts is blatantly impossible. And yet, it clearly happened. Naturally, the religions and ancient cultures of the world have their own explanations of what supposedly happened. The Children of the Flame \u00b6 The Children of the Flame , prior to the publishing of The Account , believed that The End of Everything - known to them as \u201cThe Inferno\u201d at the time - was the result of the Deliverer killing and burning an entity known as the False One. Since the publishing of The Account, the accepted belief within the group has changed.

In an effort to simplify the keeping of time around the world, the Unified Timekeeping Standard was proposed in 1523 by an independent group of merchants, and has been in use worldwide since 1549. The standard was not made retroactive, so any dates and times found in documents and media written prior to when a given country adopted the standard should be assumed to have been written using the system that was in use in that place at that time. However, the standard does account for retroactive use in current times, so all dates and times found in documents and media written since 1549, even if the date written is before that year, can be assumed to be written in the Unified Timekeeping Standard. Country Year adopted Country Year Adopted Alastor 1530 Osun Tanum Since formation Corstaea 1537 Sangyon 1524 Destrea Since formation Shaohou 1549 Grenneria 1532 Shinzen 1540 Ilmaria Since formation Ustonia Since formation Dates \u00b6 The Unified Timekeeping Standard defines the average calendar year as 365.2425 days long. It is a solar calendar with 12 months of 28-31 days each, totaling 365 days when it is not a leap year. During a leap year, an additional day is added to the second month. The months are aligned with the four seasons, with spring beginning with the third month, summer with the sixth month, autumn with the ninth month, and winter with the 12th month. Leap years Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400. For example, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 are not leap years, but the years 1600 and 2000 are. Dates are written numerically in year-month-day format (YYYY/MM/DD), month/day format (MM/DD), or week/day format (W##/D). The use of hyphens as separators is acceptable, but the slash is the standard choice. The months of the year and days of the week are not named under this standard, as it is exclusively numerical. Some cultures have their own names for the months and days, or even retain traditional names from another method of timekeeping alongside the standard, but most of the world simply refers to the months and days numerically, typically moving the year to the end of the date when spoken. For instance, the date 2033/10/30 would be spoken as \u201cTenth month, thirtieth day, twenty thirty three.\u201d A common shorthand used in speech around the world is to drop the year entirely, along with the words \u201cmonth\u201d and \u201cday\u201d, and state the day before the month. For instance, 10/30 would be spoken in shorthand as \u201cThirtieth of the tenth.\u201d The week-day (W##/D) or year-week-day (YYYY/W##/D) format is also defined in the standard, but is typically used only in the context of work or school due to how cumbersome most people feel it is to use and keep track of. The year-month-day date of 2033/10/30 equates to 2033/W43/7 in weekly format. Most of the world offers students two days off at the end of each week, and employees typically receive one to three days off at the end of each week, so even though the week-day format is rarely used otherwise, the concept of the weekend is easily understood by most people around the world, and it is not uncommon for people to specify a day of a week when speaking. For instance, 10/30 in weekly format could be spoken as \u201cSeventh of next week,\u201d \u201cSeventh of this week,\u201d \u201cSeventh of last week,\u201d \u201cSeventh of two weeks ago,\u201d etc. Time \u00b6 The Unified Timekeeping Standard defines a day as being 24 hours long, an hour as being 60 minutes long, and a minute as being 60 seconds long. Time is written in hour:minute format (HH:MM) beginning from 00:00 and ending at 23:59. This 24 hour format has been in use worldwide since 1962, rather than as two 12 hour divisions beginning at 01:00 and ending at 12:59, as some countries preferred. The first hour of the day (00:00) is defined as when the moon is at its highest point, called midnight, and the 13th hour of the day (12:00) is defined as when the sun is at its highest point, called midday. To facilitate this standard, the planet is divided into 24 time zones, each offset by one hour. The dividing lines of these time zones follow planetary longitude as closely as possible, but often deviate to conform with political or legal boundaries, as it is more convenient for the people in such areas. The UT time zone, denoted as UT\u00b100, is between 0\u00b0 and 15\u00b0 longitude, with every additional 15\u00b0 adding a positive one hour offset, up to a maximum of UT+11. Every -15\u00b0 longitude starting from 0\u00b0 adds a negative one hour offset, up to a maximum of UT-12. The time zones of UT-12, UT+10, and UT+11 cover almost exclusively international waters and are virtually never observed as a result. Pilots and ship captains typically use UT\u00b100, regardless of their location, to ensure that they are always in sync and on time to prevent confusion when travelling between time zones, though some military forces may prefer to synchronize to their home time zone regardless of location. Daylight saving \u00b6 Daylight saving time is the practice of advancing clocks, typically by one hour, during warmer months so that darkness falls at a later clock time, primarily for the theoretical energy savings and economical benefits. The Unified Timekeeping Standard does not change with a change of seasons, but local time may change if a time zone jurisdiction observes daylight saving time. This practice was first proposed in 1815 by a Ustonian man as a joke, but was adopted by most of the world by 1904. It was abolished less than one year after adoption in Sangyon, being reverted before the scheduled date due to overwhelmingly negative public response, and later abolished by most other countries by 1950. Today, it is considered archaic and obsolete by the vast majority of people, foolish by many, and even irresponsible by some. Only Ustonia has continued to use daylight saving time, but as industrialization and urbanization continued to transform the country, public opinion of daylight saving time continued to decline sharply, citing public health risk, increased traffic fatalities (particularly among commuting schoolchildren), lost productivity, increased rate of workplace injuries, stock market disruption, and even more grievances caused by the changing of the clocks. In 2022, after four failed attempts, Ustonia revised the federal law regarding daylight saving time, allowing individual states to choose whether they will observe daylight saving time seasonally, or permanently observe either daylight saving time or standard time. Within the year, 17 of the 19 states of Ustonia voted with overwhelming support to permanently observe standard time, while the state of Stonesea voted for permanent daylight saving time, and the state of Arkbay voted to continue seasonally changing clocks. Stonesea reverted to permanent standard time only two years later after severe backlash from its citizens, the majority of whom were previously in favor of daylight saving time. To this day, the state of Arkbay is the only place in the world that observes daylight saving time, and it continues to attract mockery and cause international confusion and frustration.

Inazuma Clan Type Noble Clan Years active 1141-1504 1966-present Historical location Shizumori, Hayagawa, Shinzen Current location Shiga, Onsai, Shinzen The Inazuma Clan (\u96fb) was a small family of fox spirits that lived in relative seclusion, known primarily for their affinity with lightning - known now to have been a method of utilizing Attunement passed down through the family as tradition - who were given their noble status and lordship over their land by the Imperial Court. Their ancestral lands are historically known as Shizumori , found in northern Hayagawa . The family resisted the Kagetsu shogunate and was almost completely wiped out prior to the Siege of Soukotan at the end of the Ikute period . They maintained isolationist behavior for their entire reign and were entirely self supported. Being secluded deep within a forest, extremely few outsiders ever visited their lands, and most that did got there on accident while traveling, but outsiders were almost always treated with uncanny hospitality, leading to the clan eventually building a rather mystical reputation that slowly spread throughout northern Shinzen . Another result of their seclusion is that unfortunately, not much is known about the Inazuma, due to the fact that a huge amount of the knowledge about their existence comes from likely exaggerated stories and rumors, and the biased and defunct Kagetsu shogunate. The words of Nori and Shun - the only surviving members of the Inazuma - are hotly debated. In 1966, Nori and Shun returned to Shinzen and their noble status was officially recognized as a symbolic gesture. They now reside in rural Shiga in the state of Onsai . History \u00b6 Origins \u00b6 According to legend, the Emperor was returning to the capital after a tour of his lands and found himself lost in unfamiliar woods, separated from his entourage. Remaining calm, he chose to sit down in that spot and wait to be found. After a full day and night, he was awakened by the sound of falling bodies and saw a fox spirit cutting down an assailant before him. This fox spirit offered her hand to him and led him to her home, gave him food and drink, then led him back to what remained of his entourage. He then asked her to demonstrate her sword skills once more on the bamboo surrounding them, and was astonished by not only her lightning fast speed, but also that her sword was truly emanating lightning as it sliced through the air. He then gave her the family name Inazuma, declared that she and her family shall be recognized as nobility, and granted her official ownership of the land surrounding her home. According to Nori and Shun, the Inazuma family line did begin with that fox woman alone, though she never married, instead bearing children on accident. She bore triplet daughters, one of whom killed her before fleeing to Shaohou and abandoning her name. The remaining two daughters, possibly out of spite for their sister, took husbands and began the true Inazuma legacy. They otherwise neither confirm nor deny the validity of the legend. Kagetsu resistance \u00b6 Historically, the Kagetsu clan toured the lands and confronted every daimy\u014d, giving each the ultimatum of subjugation or death, before ultimately overthrowing the shogun in the Siege of Soukotan and unifying Shinzen as one nation. A huge majority of the daimy\u014d chose to resist and were wiped out, including the Inazuma. The Kagetsu described their opposition as stubborn fools clinging to their old ways, against the progress of the nation, and were particularly vitriolic in their description of the Inazuma, describing them as lapdogs clinging to the corpse of their master. Kagetsu accounts claim that a messenger was sent to the Inazuma to inform them peacefully of the coming ultimatum, and was killed by the Inazuma. The ensuing battle was a decisive victory for the Kagetsu, leaving no survivors and taking no losses. They then razed the village, leaving it in ruin. Nori and Shun, who were both present for these events, tell a different story. According to them, the messenger was not killed, but instead treated with the same hospitality as any other outsider, and chose independently to desert the Kagetsu and stand with the Inazuma because of it. They also claim that the Kagetsu were not the heroes history portrays them as, and that their true motivation was akin to an ethnic cleansing, the Inazuma in particular being targeted for being fox spirits, who they believed to be subhuman. The messenger chose to desert due to a guilty conscience after seeing the error of those beliefs. The ensuing battle was relentless and far from decisive, with the Kagetsu taking heavy losses, including two important retainers. The Inazuma knew from the start that they could not win, but swore to take as many Kagetsu with them as possible, going so far as to set fire to their own village and the surrounding forest. Nori and Shun were told to use the fires to their advantage and escape with their lives, and to remember these events. What they say is not just plausible, but likely true, given that several notable individuals associated with the Kagetsu seemingly disappeared just before the Siege of Soukotan, never to be mentioned again. The Kagetsu were likely humiliated and shamed by their losses to the Inazuma and chose to cover it up so as not to tarnish their reputation. This side of the story remains a subject of heated debate among historians and Shinzenese patriots and nationalists. Notable stories \u00b6 Allegedly, the same emperor who bestowed upon the Inazuma family their status visited their lands again shortly before his death, and was impressed by the family\u2019s progress in establishing their village. When he met the two daughters and learned about the death of their mother, he cried in public, and offered a blessing to the family. During the extremely brief restoration of imperial rule before the transition to the Ikute period, the emperor of the time was allegedly hosted by the Inazuma for a night and was pleased by their hospitality. No record exists of this, but it is believed due to several other families in different regions that have repeated the same story. There is a folk tale common in the state of Hayagawa of a traveling monk who fell unconscious under a tree and met a fox spirit there, who gave him rice and water. No words were exchanged between them, and when the monk was able to stand once more, the fox disappeared with a bright flash in the blink of an eye. Some believe this to have been a member of the Inazuma family. The Inazuma were remarkable sword crafters, as shown by the small handful of surviving examples. They were forged with a technique entirely unique to the Inazuma that has never been perfectly replicated, and were decorated much more ornately than any other swords throughout the history of Shinzen, most notably with vividly colored blades. One daish\u014d was allegedly given as a gift to the shogun at the start of the Ikute period, but was later lost under unknown circumstances. Historians believe this daish\u014d is one of the two examples in the national heritage museum, but are not sure which one. There are numerous reports of y\u014dkai sightings in several northern forest trails around the border between the states of Hayagawa and Miwae . According to several historical accounts, the Inazuma were most commonly sighted around that area and were viewed as guardians of the forest. This leads some to believe that these y\u014dkai are the ghosts of the Inazuma, still guarding their homeland against outsiders. 1 Author info Kit - (AKA Kerosyn, or QuickFastly) Web zone // Twitter This is true, though the people don\u2019t know the full truth.

The Inazuma knew from the start that they could not win, but swore to take as many Kagetsu with them as possible, going so far as to set fire to their own village and the surrounding forest. Nori and Shun were told to use the fires to their advantage and escape with their lives, and to remember these events. What they say is not just plausible, but likely true, given that several notable individuals associated with the Kagetsu seemingly disappeared just before the Siege of Soukotan, never to be mentioned again. The Kagetsu were likely humiliated and shamed by their losses to the Inazuma and chose to cover it up so as not to tarnish their reputation. This side of the story remains a subject of heated debate among historians and Shinzenese patriots and nationalists.","title":"Kagetsu resistance"},{"location":"Nova-Regna/World/History%20%26%20Events/Shinzen/Inazuma%20Clan/#notable-stories","text":"Allegedly, the same emperor who bestowed upon the Inazuma family their status visited their lands again shortly before his death, and was impressed by the family\u2019s progress in establishing their village. When he met the two daughters and learned about the death of their mother, he cried in public, and offered a blessing to the family. During the extremely brief restoration of imperial rule before the transition to the Ikute period, the emperor of the time was allegedly hosted by the Inazuma for a night and was pleased by their hospitality. No record exists of this, but it is believed due to several other families in different regions that have repeated the same story. There is a folk tale common in the state of Hayagawa of a traveling monk who fell unconscious under a tree and met a fox spirit there, who gave him rice and water. No words were exchanged between them, and when the monk was able to stand once more, the fox disappeared with a bright flash in the blink of an eye. Some believe this to have been a member of the Inazuma family. The Inazuma were remarkable sword crafters, as shown by the small handful of surviving examples. They were forged with a technique entirely unique to the Inazuma that has never been perfectly replicated, and were decorated much more ornately than any other swords throughout the history of Shinzen, most notably with vividly colored blades. One daish\u014d was allegedly given as a gift to the shogun at the start of the Ikute period, but was later lost under unknown circumstances. Historians believe this daish\u014d is one of the two examples in the national heritage museum, but are not sure which one. There are numerous reports of y\u014dkai sightings in several northern forest trails around the border between the states of Hayagawa and Miwae . According to several historical accounts, the Inazuma were most commonly sighted around that area and were viewed as guardians of the forest. This leads some to believe that these y\u014dkai are the ghosts of the Inazuma, still guarding their homeland against outsiders. 1 Author info Kit - (AKA Kerosyn, or QuickFastly) Web zone // Twitter This is true, though the people don\u2019t know the full truth.

They have existed since Era Dira . History \u00b6 Nothing for now. Myths and legends \u00b6 Crow spirits believe that spirits were not only created by gods in ancient times, but that the crows are the only spirits to have had an ancient goddess among their own kind. This goddess, called Morrigan, was the first of the crow spirits. She was created by the other gods of the old world as a servant to them, but she rejected the gods and went on to become known as the physical manifestation of terror and death itself, killing hundreds of thousands of people in her furious defiance. Her first child, Florian , rejected her violent ways and dedicated himself to the pursuit of knowledge to end disputes without bloodshed. The sight of his dedication and the sound of his constant pleading eventually mellowed her heart, and she humbly allowed him to teach her many things, leading her to become repentant for her actions. The gods later plotted to wipe out all of her children in retaliation for her crimes, but as one final act of atonement, she gave her own life in exchange for their survival. Florian himself has expressed his distaste for this belief on many occassions, but has never offered an alternative or correction to the story. Anatomy & physiology \u00b6 All crow spirits inherently have Alignment and Attunement . Crow spirits are the only type of major spirit that occasionally displays no physical animalistic features. Most of them possess a set of black, iridescent tail feathers, and some can also display feathers on other parts of their body, most often on their forearms. Sometimes, their hair may appear iridescent as well. They have only been seen with black or gray hair. In extremely rare cases, their arms can develop wings that grant them the ability to glide short distances and break falls from any height, provided there is enough ground space to glide along and slow down. These wings do not enable flight, and cause significant challenges with fitting clothes and performing many day to day tasks. Aside from those features, crow spirits come in all the same shapes and sizes as humans , but are much thinner on average, have significantly weaker bones, are extremely susceptible to developing dark circles around their eyes, and tend to have naturally unruly hair. They typically look rather tired and disheveled because of this and their rapidly aging appearances. Crow spirits, like birds, are capable of perceiving the magnetic field of the planet, giving them an internal compass. They also tend to be extremely proficient in mimicry and ingenuity. Life cycle \u00b6 Crow spirits grow at the same rate as humans until the age of 15 years, after which they typically appear to begin aging rapidly. Some even have their hair go completely gray before the age of 20, or develop wrinkles before the age of 40. Despite this appearance, they otherwise age at the same rate as humans. Geographic distribution \u00b6 They have no preferences for climate or geography and can be found all around the world. They are spread quite thin, making them a rare sight. Some live on the desolate island of Electra in the country of Alastor , and seem to be the only people capable of remaining there for extended periods of time. Sociology \u00b6 Crow spirits are reclusive pacifists and historians. They are very well spoken but choose not to speak at all most of the time, worried about speaking inappropriately and giving negative impressions. Despite this, due to their common belief in the goddess Morrigan and her acts of love and repentance, they tend to leverage their extensive knowledge of history to silently pull strings from the shadows and exert a slight - but not insignificant - amount of pragmatic influence on many parts of the world. On their own, they tend to be quite mysterious and strange.

They have existed since Era Dira . History \u00b6 Nothing for now. Myths and legends \u00b6 It is said that in ancient times, Dvalinn led an attack on the wolf spirits when they were vulnerable, claiming that the wolves were ravaging the nature around them and could not be allowed to continue. They overwhelmed the wolves and severely thinned their numbers, but just before the battle was won, Garm single-handedly turned the battle around, mercilessly slaughtering many deer spirits in desperation, including Dvalinn. These events are what led the deer spirits to split into two factions, with most deciding that what they did was wrong and wishing to repent, and a fringe group believing they were in the right and growing bitter and hateful. Anatomy & physiology \u00b6 All deer spirits inherently have Alignment and Attunement . Deer spirits all possess a pair of antlers on their head, including those born female. The position, size, and shape of these antlers varies wildly across individuals, but there appears to be an element of heredity with close family members usually having relatively similar antlers to each other. No deer spirits aside from Dvalinn ever grow whitetail antlers, however. These antlers do not produce velvet and do not fall off seasonally. They are incredibly hard to break, but do grow back if broken. Some deer spirits may also have horizontal pupils, a tail, or animal ears. These features are all somewhat uncommon, and seem to develop at random with no heredity. They all have extraordinary eyesight, particularly in peripheral vision, and senses of smell several times more sensitive than the average human. Those with animal ears also have heightened hearing, and highly accurate directional hearing. Life cycle \u00b6 Deer spirits grow at slightly under half the rate of humans, not reaching full physical maturity until 30-40 years of age rather than 15-20. Despite this, they reach mental maturity sooner than humans at the age of 18-20 rather than 24-30, making them quite the anomaly in average society. Most areas of the world that recognize the spirit population have doubled their normal age of consent and minimum age to drink alcohol or use recreational substances for deer spirits to account for this. Geographic distribution \u00b6 Deer spirits have a strong preference for seasonal forested regions. The majority of deer spirits are found in Shinzen , but they can be found in rural areas with mild climates across most of the world. Meanwhile, the fringe faction is found deep inside dense forests all around the world. Deer spirits are also common throughout the lush island of Panacea , serving as its keepers and considered vital to the people of Alastor . Sociology \u00b6 The majority of deer spirits are typically very shy and gentle pacifists who idealize nature and want nothing more than peace and harmony. They are known to be very awkward, but passionate in their interests and very loyal to their friends. Most of these spirits tend to live in suburbs and rural areas near larger cities, where they are often found as outspoken environmental activists. The fringe faction of deer spirits reject society entirely and choose to live deep in dense forests. Their bitter hatred of all those who exploit nature without giving back led them to become extremely hostile to the vast majority of people who enter their forests uninvited. They have brutally murdered thousands of humans throughout history. While there are accounts of people entering their forests and not only coming out alive, but having a positive experience, the terrible stories are far more widely known. Because of the fringe faction, deer spirits are commonly believed by humans to be terrifying figures, causing a lot of trouble for the majority of deer spirits, which led them to become so shy and awkward. It is common for deer spirits to adorn their antlers with flowers and vines for the first week of spring, and leaves for the first week of autumn. The origin of this tradition has been lost to time, but it is continued nonetheless. Interracial relations \u00b6 The majority of deer spirits hold all forms of life in very high regard and make every effort to live in harmony with everything as equals. The fringe faction, however, reserve their opinions for individuals that give them a reason to form one.

The fringe faction of deer spirits reject society entirely and choose to live deep in dense forests. Their bitter hatred of all those who exploit nature without giving back led them to become extremely hostile to the vast majority of people who enter their forests uninvited. They have brutally murdered thousands of humans throughout history. While there are accounts of people entering their forests and not only coming out alive, but having a positive experience, the terrible stories are far more widely known. Because of the fringe faction, deer spirits are commonly believed by humans to be terrifying figures, causing a lot of trouble for the majority of deer spirits, which led them to become so shy and awkward.

They have existed since Era Dira . History \u00b6 Nothing for now. Myths and legends \u00b6 Throughout history, fox spirits have believed a unique version of the common creation myth . In their version, the world was purged at the end of Era Dira and rebuilt by Kerosyn , no other god. Fox spirits were the only ones to believe this until the publication of The Account , which they then accepted as a correction of their version.

It is said that in ancient times, fox spirits taught humans how to manipulate mystic matter , then unleashed a horde of house cats on the humans, distracting them and causing the accidental creation of cat spirits. Anatomy & physiology \u00b6 All fox spirits inherently have Alignment and Attunement . Fox spirits all possess animal ears and at least one tail. Rarely, they may also possess claws that may or may not be retractable, or fur anywhere on the body, the amount, density, and location of which varies wildly. In extremely rare cases, they can even possess digitigrade feet. Their fur, where present, becomes thicker in the winter and may change color depending on their region. All of these rare features seem to be hereditary. Fox spirits all have vastly superior hearing to humans, capable on average of hearing sounds up to 45 kHz with a particular sensitivity to low frequency sounds, picking out the squeak of a mouse in a field from 100 feet away, and pinpoint directional accuracy due to being able to independently move their ears. Depending on the species of fox that the spirit shares their features with, their ears may be larger than average or differently shaped, which can increase their hearing abilities further. Their eyes have vertical slit pupils, are capable of exceptional vision in the dark with only one tenth the light required for humans to see anything in the dark, can perceive the geomagnetic field, and are extremely sensitive to movement. Shortsightedness, cataracts, and even blindness are relatively common developments in older fox spirits, but sight-challenged fox spirits typically function very well by relying instead on their hearing and magnetic vision, but most do not develop these problems until at least 300 years of age, and many others never develop these problems at all. Fox spirits have the best reflexes and sense of balance of all spirits, and potentially all living things. Their bodies are naturally extremely agile and flexible as well, which combined with their small size and light weight, allows fox spirits incredible, almost supernatural movement abilities. Male and female fox spirits typically grow to the same average height, with females being lighter weight. Males posses predominantly feminine facial features and body shapes and do not grow facial hair, and females experience incredibly subtle breast development, making it virtually impossible to determine their sex by looking at them with clothes on. Their voices typically occupy very similar frequency ranges as well, making it even harder to determine without asking directly. Life cycle \u00b6 Fox spirits grow at the same rate as humans until the age of 15 years, after which their aging begins to slow. By the age of 100 years, they appear only 30 years old by human standards. The oldest known fox spirit claims to be over 1,000 years old, but only appears 50 years old by human standards. They appear to be virtually immortal, but this cannot be confirmed or denied. Fox spirits have been studied extensively and there have yet to be any conclusive findings on the subject of their aging. Fox spirits undergo a physical change every century after their first. Most commonly, at 200 years their tail will split into two, then three at 300 years, and so on. For some their tail simply becomes larger rather than splitting, and sometimes their ears grow larger as well. The reason for these changes is unknown, but is speculated to be a result of their attunement strengthening over time. Geographic distribution \u00b6 Fox spirits have no preference for climate or terrain, and can be found anywhere in the world. With their tiny population, they are an incredibly rare sight. Statistically, they are most likely to be seen in Alastor , but even there they remain a rare sight. The only known surviving multi-generational settlement of fox spirits in the world is located there with a population of 193. Sociology \u00b6 Fox spirits are free-spirited nomads, rarely staying in one place for more than one generation. They are known as innocent pranksters, and for their carefree, curious, and lighthearted personalities, leading many to believe that they are a race of perpetual children, or even idiots. In truth, they are hiding lightning fast wits along with vast wisdom and knowledge behind their childlike appearances. Regardless of ethnicity and culture, fox spirits tend to prefer names with two or three clear, simple, easy to pronounce syllables. They do not give middle names to their children, allowing them instead to adopt their own middle name later in life, be it a nickname they\u2019ve picked up, a preferred name, or something meaningful in some way. They also tend to call other non-fox people by nicknames, even when their real names are short and simple. Males and females are treated as absolute equals among their kind, with both sexes sharing all the same roles, responsibilities, and expectations, and they do not identify any behaviors or personality traits as masculine or feminine. To them, the only reason to distinguish the sexes is to reproduce, and they tend not to think about that. They are typically asexual and aromantic, but may develop an innocent crush and turn out to be demiromantic and/or demisexual. They prefer to move very slowly in relationships and partner monogamously for life, with a divorce rate near zero among their own kind. Fox spirits are also mostly adamant on having only one child, should they start a family, except in the case of a multiple birth, though it was less rare for fox spirit families to have two or three children by choice prior to the modern era. An incredibly common practice among fox spirits is to keep a series of journals or diaries, usually on a weekly schedule, or at least for major events in their lives. Fox spirits have great memories, far better than that of humans, but it\u2019s impossible even for them to remember multiple centuries accurately. Interracial relations \u00b6 They view all species, intelligent or not, as equally important and do not give any single species special treatment over any other. With their extremely long lives and innocent hearts, they are naturally impartial to politics that do not threaten the lives of others and typically choose not to think about that, but some fox spirits develop a different attitude through their life experiences.

They come in many varieties . They are distinct from Spirits due to their lack of anything special or unique. History \u00b6 Humans have existed on Earth since Era Dira , as confirmed by the existence of various artifacts dated at over 3000 years old, but there is yet to be a consensus on just how old the human species is thought to be, or its origin. Anatomy & physiology \u00b6 Meta This information is all in comparison to the real world for brevity and convenience. Humans in this world are, on average, slightly stronger, faster, and more durable than humans in the real world. Their fast twitch muscles are stronger and wear out slower, their reflexes are faster and reaction times shorter, and their bones are both denser and slightly more elastic. The average strength gap between males and females is also much narrower. This is unashamedly for the purpose of justifying cooler action scenes, especially when considering that the average human in this world is closer to that of a trained athlete in the real world, so the most exceptional humans in this world may be capable of some truly insane feats. Use and abuse this all you want. Bones are twice as hard to break, both from impact force and bending Average sprint speed is 16 mph (25.7 kph) and can last 12 seconds Average reaction times are 150 ms visual, and 110 ms auditory Average unconscious reflex time is only 50 ms G force resistance is as follows: Sustained vertical Gs (10 sec): -3 to +6 on average, -5 to +10 with peak training Conventional G-suits can add 2 positive Gs, and double the sustainable time Sustained horizontal Gs (10 sec): 23 on average, 30 with peak training Short peak impact Gs: Up to 55 uninjured (when harnessed), 195 theoretical max Average strength is as follows: Squat: 1.9x body weight for males, 1.7x body weight for females Bench: 1.5x body weight for males, 1.2x body weight for females Deadlift: 2x body weight for both males and females Overhead press: 1x body weight for males, 0.9x body weight for females Pushups: 50 for males, 40 for females Pull-ups: 20 for males, 16 for females Planks: 90 seconds for both males and females Regarding the implications on resistance to weapons this may imply, there are only two factors to keep in mind, regardless of whether or not the following lines up with real-world knowledge and understanding of human physiology or the laws physics. Bullet resistance is not increased, aside from a slightly higher chance of small caliber, low power bullets ricocheting off of the skull at certain angles. Blade resistance is also not increased, not even in the bones. What increased resistance the higher bone density provides is offset by the higher arm strength of the attacker, and the metallurgy of the world may also help compensate. These increased abilities therefore will not allow humans in this world to survive running through a war zone or being stabbed or cut severely just to be cool. They are intended only to allow humans to fight at full strength for longer periods of time, react and move faster, and endure more blunt force trauma, e.g. fist fighting. In short, you still need to write fight scenes with a degree of realism in mind. The limits that are commonly pushed in fiction for style anyway are simply now a quantified and justified default. Unrealistic feats even with these limits in mind can still be written, but should take some serious thought first.

While it is certainly not unheard of for people to discriminate against others on the basis of skin color or cultural differences in this world, the severity of that discrimination is not as severe as in the real world, except in the case of extreme nationalism. The concept of race, and with it the worst of the discrimination and oppression in this world is focused instead on the divide between humans and spirits, because they are entirely different species. For most of history, humans have been strongly prejudiced against spirits of all types, and have constantly perpetuated discrimination, hate crimes, and even genocides against them. In recent years, this racism has sharply declined as more and more of the world works to change their treatment towards spirits, but some holdouts will likely always remain.

They have existed since Era Dira . History \u00b6 Nothing for now. Myths and legends \u00b6 A common legend spread among mouse spirits is the story of the god of knowledge. It is said that in ancient times, the god of knowledge wrote all there ever was, and ever would be, to know in countless tomes, which were stored away in an inconceivably large library, hidden away deep in the earth. While the god of knowledge has since died, the god\u2019s daughter is still living, watching over the library, awaiting the arrivals of the faithful. Mouse spirits who believe this legend will invariably set out on a worldwide journey in search of the mythical hidden library.

Some also believe that the successful ones are guided personally by Haida , whose words can sway even the least faithful into seeking the library. Anatomy & physiology \u00b6 All mouse spirits inherently have Alignment . All mouse spirits have either black or red eyes, animal ears, and pronounced upper central incisors. Many also possess a tail, and some even possess whiskers. In very rare cases, they can experience continuously growing incisors that require regular filing. All mouse spirits suffer from moderate to severe nearsightedness, but also have incredible hearing, capable of hearing sounds up to 40 kHz. Their skeletons are noticeably more brittle than humans , and their muscles significantly weaker by weight. Life cycle \u00b6 Mouse spirits grow at the same rate as human until the age of 12 years, after which much of their physical growth largely stops, giving them their characteristic small stature. At age 20, they appear to stop aging entirely until around 40 years of age, at which point their hair begins to turn gray, though no other signs of aging occur. Around 50 years of age, they appear to skip directly from young adulthood to elderly by human standards. Geographic distribution \u00b6 Mouse spirits prefer warm, mild climates, and the vast majority of them can be found in Osun Tanum for most of the year. They have been known to travel in droves seasonally. They are also common throughout Alastor , regularly relied upon for the management of the country\u2019s complex systems of governance, and are credited as the primary reason it continues to run efficiently. Sociology \u00b6 Mouse spirits are filled with wonder and always eager to learn new things, notable for their close relationship with human society second only to the cat spirits . They are also known to be very skittish, and while many humans will claim they don\u2019t know why, the mouse spirits are quite outspoken about the common demeaning treatment they receive for their small stature and childlike appearances, mostly from humans and cat spirits. Despite that, they carry on largely undeterred, and are typically among the highest echelons of academia and their chosen professions. Their endless natural curiosity combined with their short life expectancies make them uniquely motivated and driven individuals. Female mouse spirits outnumber male mouse spirits over 20 to 1, and historically the gap was even larger. Due to this, the females traditionally are the ones to take initiative in forming relationships, and polygamy among mouse spirits is more common than monogamy. Interracial relations \u00b6 Despite the demeaning treatment they often receive, they hold no prejudices and are always very eager to learn about other races, though this can occasionally come off as insensitive by asking questions bluntly without realizing.

As the wars got bigger, the shark spirits lost more and more of their people every day until they were nearing extinction. It was then that Kuhai stepped in and urged the shark spirits to change. When they refused, Kuhai confronted the enemy alone, absorbing everything the enemy could muster without even lifting a finger. Unfazed, Kuhai delivered a speech both to the enemy and her own people. The enemy halted their attack, and the shark spirits kneeled before them, bringing an end to their senseless violence. While this story is believed by all shark spirits, other people have countless interpretations of it and the shark spirits don\u2019t care enough to clarify, relegating this story to legend. An important factor to note, however, is that this legend is very recent, potentially less than even 500 years old. Anatomy & physiology \u00b6 All shark spirits possess at least one row of razor sharp pointed teeth, but no more than three, a set of gills on the sides of their neck that open underwater, and a tail with a large vertical fin and occasionally additional smaller fins. Some shark spirits may also have fins protruding from their ears, forearms, calves, or even a dorsal fin on their upper back, all of which will share the same skin coloring and texturing of their tail. Very rarely, some shark spirits may also have shark skin on other parts of their body, typically lower legs, forearms, or the backs of their hands and feet, or even webbed hands. All shark spirits possess a keen sense of smell on land, but it becomes truly extraordinary when underwater. They are also able to vaguely sense electrical fields, but once again, this perception truly comes into its own when underwater. Naturally, they are all exceptional swimmers. Shark spirits have significantly stronger bones and muscles than humans , and are typically very lean, causing them to sink quickly in water. They also build muscle at a blistering pace almost effortlessly, making them require a bodybuilder\u2019s diet just to survive. Life cycle \u00b6 Shark spirits grow at the same rate as humans, but continue to grow taller for an additional few years, giving them their distinctive towering stature. Around 60 years of age, their hair never turns gray and their skin rarely becomes wrinkled, yet their bodies begin to wither away on the inside. As a result, the most common cause of death among shark spirits (excluding violent causes) is multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. It is theorized that this is caused by their immense everyday energy expenditure becoming too much for their bodies to handle, and that they may be able to live far longer with further advancement of medical technology. Geographic distribution \u00b6 They strongly prefer living near large bodies of water. The majority of them can be found on the southern coasts of Destrea , but they are not an uncommon sight in port towns around the world. Many can be found in Alastor , where they often serve as volunteer border and coast guards. Sociology \u00b6 Shark spirits are notoriously volatile and angry. Many of them, due to their instinctive inclinations for violence, are hooked to the thrill of fighting, leading them to join the military, where they have a reputation for being a constant source of trouble due to their short fuses and tendency to defy orders. Outside the military, they often become aimless wanderers, feeling as though their lives have no purpose due to how difficult their instincts make it for them to fit well in society. Over time, they have grown bitter with society at large, making it extremely difficult to make friends with a shark spirit without knowing exactly how to impress them. There are some rare exceptions to this majority. Shark spirits raised by at least one parent of another species tend to view the world and other people much more positively, and can become quite compassionate and friendly. They can learn to suppress their instincts, which does cause some strange quirks in their behavior, but those quirks bring the unintentional benefit of making them more likable. Interracial relations \u00b6 Shark spirits are typically quick to anger and slow to forgive, so anyone who doesn\u2019t immediately make a positive impression with them will likely be on their bad side forever. They don\u2019t care about racial differences, but tend to view most people negatively regardless.

These can manifest as features from nearly any type of animal - or in rare cases, even many types of plant - on Earth , but are typically limited to minor additions or changes to the otherwise humanlike body. They share the same cultures and ethnicities as humans do, although some groups of spirits additionally have their own subcultures, which can be either consistent worldwide or regional. They are also notable for having a strong affinity with mystic matter , even among individuals that possess neither alignment nor attunement . While spirits appear remarkably similar to humans, even to the point of being effectively identical in most anatomical aspects, they are still a distinctly different species: H. varius. Additionally, each of the many varieties of spirit is also classified with at least one subspecies. For example, the trinomial H. varius catus, or the polynomial H. varius lupus albus. Despite there likely being a type of spirit for virtually every animal, and even some varieties of plant, only eight types of spirit are of particular prominence. These eight varieties of spirit are significantly different from humans and each other, and are referred to as \u201cmajor spirits\u201d. All other varieties of spirit are referred to as \u201cminor spirits\u201d and are typically much less distinct from humans, even sometimes being hard to distinguish at all from humans or each other, while also making up only a combined ~8.5% of all spirits. However, very rare examples may be so extremely different from humans and even major spirits spirits that they can appear almost alien. History \u00b6 Spirits have existed on Earth since Era Dira , as confirmed by the existence of various artifacts dated at over 3000 years old, but there is yet to be a consensus on just how old they are, or their origins. Throughout the history of the world, spirits have been subject to extreme prejudice. Many believe that this was rooted in fear, but there is little consensus on why it persisted for so long. Spirits have been victims of multiple genocides, countless hate crimes, and extremely unfair treatment throughout history, and have never had the chance to recover, causing spirits to become an incredibly small minority of all people. To give an idea of just how much they have lost, it is thought that during Era Dira, spirits actually outnumbered humans two to one. Only in modern times has this extreme prejudice begun to wane as much of human society changes to be more accepting of spirits, though they still struggle. Spirits are often treated with cautious fascination today. Anatomy & physiology \u00b6 Most commonly, spirits possess the ears (or another head feature like antlers, antennae, fins, etc.) of their related animal, and a tail. For those with animal ears, some spirits may have only their animal ears, while others may have both animal and human ears. The eight types of major spirits also all possess major sensory changes similar to their related animals, while minor spirits typically do not. Spirits seem to be almost entirely unaffected by human allergies to anything natural, but are much more sensitive to synthetic substances on average, particularly in food and drugs. However, many spirits do often inherit some of the same substance sensitivities as their related animals. These sensitivities can vary in severity on an individual basis, but are not lethal, even if it would be lethal to the related animal. Spirits are often instinctually aware of these sensitivities. For instance, wolf spirits are repulsed by grapes and onions, and cat spirits are attracted to catnip. Caffeine is lethal to all spirits in high enough dosages. A single average cup of coffee can give any spirit noticeable heart palpitations, and can be dangerous for small or unhealthy spirits. Tea, however, is much safer for spirits and rarely causes any side effects, provided they only drink one to four cups per day, depending on the caffeine content of the brew and the body mass of the spirit. Most spirits can detect caffeine content through smell or taste even in trace amounts. Genetics and Reproduction \u00b6 Spirit genealogy and reproduction works the same way as it does for humans and they remain genetically compatible as a result. However, their genetic strength is weak against that of humans, leading most human/spirit offspring to be human, and only a small portion to be spirit. Two different types of spirit can also reproduce, but the resulting offspring will carry the physical traits of just one parent, and only very rarely inherit non-physical traits from both parents. Hybrids are almost entirely unviable between spirits, and the dominant genes in the offspring appear to be entirely random. Research has yet to ascertain the cause of this. Distribution \u00b6 Spirits are found all over the world, with certain types preferring certain climates and landscapes. Today, spirits make up approximately 5% of the world population, with major spirits making up approximately 91.5% of all spirits, and minor spirits only 8.5%.

They have existed since Era Dira . History \u00b6 Nothing for now. Myths and legends \u00b6 It is said that in ancient times, before the wolf spirits were a warrior people, they were savagely attacked by a band of deer spirits . Some believe it was out of sheer malice, others believe it was because the wolf spirits slighted them, or even that the deer were sent by the gods to deliver divine retribution. The wolf spirits took devastating losses in the attack and were ultimately bound in chains. But, in their darkest hour, Garm broke free of their chains and slaughtered their captors, a bloody display of strength so great that the deer spirits fled at the sight of it. Ever since that day, the wolf spirits picked up the sword and shield to become fierce warriors in the interest of self preservation. Anatomy & physiology \u00b6 Wolf spirits are the only type of major spirit to have fully consistent anatomy, with all of them possessing animal ears, a tail, pronounced fangs, and a very limited range of hair and eye colors. Their hair comes almost exclusively in black, white, silver, dark gray, or dull brown. They have significantly stronger bones and muscles than humans , and grow noticeably taller than them on average. Their senses are also enhanced to near equivalency with their animal counterparts, with a sense of smell almost 100 times greater than that of humans, the ability to hear some sounds up to 60 kHz and others as far as eight miles away, and exceptional eyesight, particularly in peripheral vision and motion detection, along with night vision around 50% more effective than that of humans. They are unfortunately also partially colorblind, mostly lacking vision of the color green. Life cycle \u00b6 Wolf spirits grow at the same rate as humans until the age of 50 years, at which point their aging slows slightly overall. They are all born with extremely deep and vibrant blue eyes, which they retain until around 20 years of age, at which point their eye color typically changes to a similarly deep and vibrant yellow. Between the ages of 40 and 50, that yellow color may lose its luster or even change again to a shade of brown. Beyond 50 years of age, their eyes begin to slowly lose all color and become a silvery gray. Very rarely, some may retain their blue eyes for most of their life, but nearly all wolf spirits eventually lose their eye color. However, those with Attunement typically retain their blue eyes until death. Geographic distribution \u00b6 Wolf spirits have a strong preference for cold climates, and enjoy mountainous terrain. The vast majority of them are found in the northern and central regions of Corstaea . They are also a common sight in Alastor . Sociology \u00b6 Wolf spirits are a dignified people with a deeply ingrained sense of honor and strict commitment to tradition, known for their rich culture and unique history. Most wolf spirits prefer to keep their distance from other civilization, instead settling on mountains and in the harsh northern snow, typically sticking together in fairly large groups. While they were considered technologically advanced in early history, today they typically choose to live in much the same fashion as they did back then, relying on hunting and farming for food with little to no trade. When they do trade, it\u2019s almost always with other groups of wolf spirits. They remain to this day avid practitioners of antiquated weapon-based martial arts, receiving full contact training in pairs beginning at the age of 15. A boy and a girl will be paired together and take turns receiving offensive and defensive training while regularly sparring against each other. In special cases, typically when the children are twins or close childhood friends, the pair may be two boys or two girls and may be trained cooperatively rather than competitively. It is tradition for young wolf spirits, both boys and girls, to go hunting alone at the age of ten as a coming-of-age ceremony, with the size of the game brought back holding great importance. Those who fail outright are typically banned from further hunting and not allowed to receive martial training, sometimes leading to voluntary exile after reaching adulthood, or of the entire family. While male and female wolf spirits are typically given very distinct societal roles, usually with males being hunters and females being guardians of the home, it is not unusual to see these roles occasionally reversed. Both males and females hold their opposite in high regard and do not believe anyone should be forced into a role they aren\u2019t comfortable taking, even if it is the traditional way. Typically among wolf spirits, marriage is arranged by the parents of two families, a holdover from their earliest history where marriage was primarily used to form alliances and secure bloodlines, rather than as a romantic union. It is still most often viewed as \u201csomething one must do\u201d and quietly accepted, though it is not uncommon for romance to bloom after the arrangement. Independent marriages do still happen, however, and are often met with no resistance by families. Wolf spirits are the first group in history to legitimize certain rights for women as law. They allowed their women the right to reject an arranged marriage with good cause and to marry a man of their own choosing instead, the right to divorce their husbands with good cause, and equal rights for owning property, conducting business, representation in court, and opportunities to occupy martial, royal, or political leadership positions for all of recorded history, but pressured the governments in Corstaean regions to uphold those rights as law as early as the year 672. The wolf spirits quickly expanded those rights towards allowing women to reject an arranged marriage for any reason, for anyone to marry anyone without prior arrangement if they wish - including same-sex marriages - and for women to have equal voting power far sooner than most of the world, without regard for the laws of the time. Interracial relations \u00b6 Wolf spirits are typically very wary of other races, but are especially cautious around humans and deer spirits and prefer to avoid them. Despite that, they are diplomatic by nature and will act with respect and fairness even among those they are uncomfortable around.

Its capital, Alexandria , is the central major island of the country. It is neighbored by Osun Tanum , Destrea , and Ustonia . Alastor is a lightly developed country with the world\u2019s smallest population while also having a very high population density, a very weak economy, no industrial sector, and no established military force. They maintain strict diplomatic neutrality towards all things that do not pose a threat to the country, its people, or their way of life. They have openly expressed their desire to become part of the Ozen Federation as their support would prove invaluable to the nation, but remain part of the Yulentia Trade Union under the massive weight of Destrean and Ustonian influence. Despite this, Osun Tanum has negotiated numerous trade deals exclusively with Alastor independent of the Union or Federation. The nation carries incredible notoriety around the world for being populated almost exclusively by spirits and their extreme reluctance to allow humans inside their borders. Perhaps the most infamous aspect of this reputation comes from when the Risky Witches swore to protect the nation and its people from all hostilities during The Big Event in 1991. History \u00b6 TBD Geography \u00b6 Alastor encompasses an archipelago primarily comprised of three large islands, each with their own very distinct topography and climate. The eastern island, Panacea , is home to a dense, thriving temperate rainforest, and is a sanctuary for many endangered species of fauna. The central island, Alexandria , is a fairly unexceptional temperate seasonal forest region. The western island, Electra , is home to cold desert with almost no natural plant or animal life to be found. The extraordinary states of the eastern and western islands is known to be caused by mystic matter density, but exactly how or why this happened remains a mystery. Government & Politics \u00b6 Alastor is governed by a direct deliberative democracy with no official head of state or other higher authoritative figures. There is an established group of legislators and an established judicial system, but these entities and the people working as part of them are of equal power to the rest of the citizenry, and can be disputed by anyone with a good case. Any citizen can put forward a proposal, vote on policies, dispute processes, and so on. Technically, all citizens also have the right to perform arrests on suspected criminals or detain otherwise suspicious individuals, which has thoroughly deterred most of the world from attempting to travel there without explicit provable permission. All governmental decisions are made by majority consensus after multiple gatherings, which happen all over the country twice a week on average, the results of which are sent to the currently elected legislators for review. It is theorized that if this system was adopted anywhere else in the world, the system would collapse under inefficiency, incompetence, or both, but Alastoran citizens are remarkably like-minded and continue to operate the system with remarkable efficiency and competence. Military \u00b6 There is no standing military force in Alastor. The full extent of their military strength is a small number of disarmed and converted helicopters for search and rescue purposes. Not even the national police carry weapons. Foreign relations \u00b6 Economy \u00b6 The Alastoran economy is worth 9.91 trillion CR per year with an expenditure of 78.2%, which is distributed as follows. Administration: 9.6% Education and Science: 14.3% Energy and Environment: 7.1% Food and Agriculture: 3.3% Healthcare: 18.3% Industry: 4% International Affairs: 5% Law & Order: 5.3% Social Policy: 9.7% Transportation: 6% Welfare: 17.4% The average income tax rate is 45%. It reaches up to 84% for the super wealthy, and as low as 5% for low income taxpayers. There is a standard 4% sales tax applied universally, and an additional 4% on all luxury items. The average gap between the richest and the poorest citizens is virtually nonexistent. Businesses are mostly divided between government and community ownership, but small privately owned businesses are still allowed to be run, provided they comply with extremely strict regulations and high taxes associated with the centrally planned economy. Some primary exports of Alastor are low volume skilled crafts, arts and entertainment, and flowers. Alastor relies heavily on imports to sustain the country. A universal 1% tariff is applied to all imports, plus an additional 1% on luxury items imported from within the Yulentian Trade Union, and 4% outside of it. Many imports from Osun Tanum are exempt from any tariff. Demographics \u00b6 Alastor, being populated almost exclusively by spirits, is of course the most welcoming towards them by far as the entire country is based around and run by them. In fact, while many other countries struggle with discrimination against spirits, Alastor struggles with discrimination against humans , as they are seen by many in the country as their natural enemy, and not everyone can move past that prejudice even if the human in question manages to fully integrate into Alastoran society and proves to be an ally. Population data according to Alastor foreign relations: ~99% Spirits Cat: ~23% Wolf: ~21% Mouse: ~19% Deer: ~16% Chameleon: ~7% Shark: ~4% Crow: ~1% Fox: ~1% Others: ~8% Human: 53,529 Education \u00b6 Education in Alastor is provided entirely free of charge through public schools or in-home tutoring, beginning between 4 and 8 years of age and completing between 16 and 20 years of age. Students of all ages are taught together, divided by their aptitude rather than by age. The primary focus of Alastoran education is to prepare students for adult life, rather than to prepare them for standardized tests or to join the workforce. Additional courses on specific subjects across many levels are available for students to take should they wish to. Education is compulsory under Alastoran law, but the pace is set by the individual student. Teachers are all volunteers, many of whom are also students themselves or recently graduated, and are in extremely high supply as a result, explaining the very wide variety of additional courses available for students to choose from. The Alastoran educational system produces very poor results in international test score surveys, with 10, 14, and 18 year old students consistently placing 9th, but the fairness and validity of the inclusion of Alastoran students in these surveys is hotly debated, with advocates citing that in the Alastoran model which does not teach to testing standards, students enjoy a significantly higher quality of life with dramatically reduced stress throughout their lifetimes while also typically becoming masters of the fields they pursue, and that they seem to retain vastly more of their education in long term memory than average students from other countries. Health \u00b6 Healthcare in Alastor is entirely public and provided to all patients free of charge, funded entirely by taxes and donations. As a result, insurance is not a concept in Alastor, nor are patients even required to prove citizenship to receive care. Due to the small size of the country and its economy, access to equipment and pharmaceuticals is limited, but Alastoran doctors and surgeons receive some of the best training in the world despite that. Alastor is also the only country in the world currently utilizing Attunement in medical practice. The overall health of Alastoran citizens is above average.

From life, Progress Type Federation Location Ozen Year of Formation 1448 Capital \u00d8sterlund Government Parliamentary democracy Currency Krone - kr (CKR) 1 CR = ~0.019 kr GDP 292.3 trillion CR/yr Population ~238,000,000 National animal Wolf National flower Edelweiss Corstaea, officially known as the Democratic Federation of Corstaea, is a moderately sized country located on the western third of the continent of Ozen , and is a member of the Ozen Federation . Its capital, \u00d8sterlund , is located on the lower eastern coast of the country in the state of Vallastad . It is bordered by Grenneria and Osun Tanum . Corstaea is a well developed country with a relatively large population, a reasonable post-industrial economy, and a moderately sized but highly specialized military. Corstaea is highly renowned for their naval prowess with numerous world-first records to their name, including being the first to sail, first to circumnavigate the globe, and first to construct an all-metal ship, as well as pioneering many naval technologies such as propeller drives, jet drives, submarines, and aircraft carriers. They are the foremost world leader in naval technology to this day. While the health and happiness of the people are the top priority of Corstaea, the unique parliamentary system of the country struggles with inefficiency and excessive red tape due to the involvement of an aristocracy, each family with their own agendas, all vying for the chance to become the Prime Minister. Though, this internal power struggle also manages to self regulate, as no sweeping changes are made if they would be unfair or detrimental to the common people, and since the majority of people aren\u2019t even fully aware of these strange inner workings, the country is considered one of the most desirable places to live in the world. History \u00b6 TBD Geography \u00b6 Corstaea contains highly varied topography, from flatlands to extreme mountains, but is almost entirely boreal in climate, and is heavily forested in all areas that support it. Himlav\u00e5rd spans the entire eastern border of the country. Government & Politics \u00b6 Corstaea is a democratic federal republic under a bicameral parliamentary system. Using a highly adapted model of social democracy, members of the House of Commons are elected by the public and appointed in such a way to maximize representation, while members of the Council are appointed exclusively by the elected Prime Minister. Both houses hold equal power and responsibility to keep each other in check. The Council has evolved uniquely to support an aristocratic government without compromising fair representation in government. It takes a lot of money to run for Prime Minister, leading the only candidates to be members of any of the various elite, noble, or royal families in the country. The resulting power struggle among this upper class historically led to a system akin to dictatorship, but with the introduction of the House of Commons, they have been able to continue their own internal power struggles without dragging the rest of the country into it. That said, it is also important to note that despite this complication, the country has never experienced oppression or other abuses of power since the introduction of the parliament. The Council is composed of seven seats with the Prime Minister reigning supreme. The remaining six seats consist of the Minister of Health, Minister of Education, Minister of the State, Minister of Defense, Minister of Energy, and Minister of Commerce. Administrative divisions \u00b6 Affolstein Allenthal Carlow Halstrand Hartmond Manden Sarrac Tolred Torstr\u00f8m Vallastad Vinesse Military \u00b6 The Corstaean military is divided into five main branches, being the Army, Navy, Coast Guard, Air Force, and Home Guard. The country enjoyed centuries of absolute naval dominance, and while that dominance has faded in recent years, they still retain their well-earned prestigious naval reputation as their navy is the best trained in the world. Foreign relations \u00b6 Economy \u00b6 The Corstaean economy is worth 292.3 trillion CR per year with an expenditure of 47.3%, which is distributed as follows. Administration: 8.1% Defense: 6.8% Education & Science: 18.8% Energy & Environment: 8.7% Food & Agriculture: 3.6% Healthcare: 11.8% Industry: 2.1% International Affairs: 6.7% Law & Order: 6.3% Social Policy: 6.8% Transportation: 6.6% Welfare: 13.7% The average income tax rate is 41%, and is much higher for the wealthy, alongside an annual 1% tax on net assets over 5 million CR. There is a universal 17.5% sales tax on all luxury purchases applied by the Ozen Federation, called the OMT or Ozen Maintenance Tax. The average gap between the richest and the poorest citizens is very small. State owned businesses are common, but most businesses are privately owned and highly diversified. Corporate taxes are relatively high, but not prohibitively so, ensuring small businesses still have a chance to thrive in the country. Some primary exports of Corstaea are cheese, energy technology, and skilled labor. Corstaea applies import tariffs ranging from 2% to 14% depending on the goods imported from any country outside of the Ozen Federation, and no tariffs within it. Demographics \u00b6 Corstaea has the highest known total population of spirits in the world, with over 20,000,000 spirits of several varieties, though the overwhelming majority are wolves with the second most common variety being cats. Precise population information of spirits is not available as Corstaea does not record such information in their census anymore, as part of their aggressive initiative to allow spirits to fully integrate into their society and be free from discrimination. The initiative is showing signs of success as the country is the third most welcoming towards spirits in the world, but it has a ways to go. Education \u00b6 Education in Corstaea is provided primarily by public schools, which are tuition-free and provide all required educational materials, appropriate clothing or uniforms, and lunches to their students free of charge regardless of economic status. The Corstaean school system is typically divided into three levels, being elementary (grades 1-7), lower secondary (grades 7-10), and upper secondary (grades VG1-VG3). Elementary and lower secondary education are compulsory under Corstaean law. Private schools exist, but are strictly regulated and are rare as a result. Private schools are only legally permitted to operate if they provide a significantly unique alternative method of education that has been proven to produce satisfactory results. Families below a certain threshold of economic status are entitled to financial grants from the Ozen Federation to allow them to select a private school if they wish. Education standards are set by the Minister of Education and their board of advisors, and while each new minister has the power to change the goals of the national education programs, they do not have the power to reduce school funding or student financial assistance. Test scores are the typical choice to determine student performance, but numerous alternatives come and go frequently, both from the Minister of Education and from the various higher education schools that require applicants to achieve certain qualifications to enroll. The Corstaean educational system produces above average results, with 4th, 8th, and 12th grade students consistently being ranked 4th in international test score surveys. Health \u00b6 Healthcare in Corstaea is provided universally to all citizens of the Ozen Federation, primarily through nationally owned and operated hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies, all of which are paid with tax revenue and therefore do not charge patients at all for any care they receive. Privately owned alternatives exist, but are legally required to be operated as non-profit businesses and are subject to extreme regulation to ensure that all patients of any economic status can receive equal levels of care, with the Ozen Federation providing financial support to those that cannot afford the allowed charges from these businesses. The overall health of Corstaean citizens is above average.

Its capital, Syrres , is located near the eastern edge of the southern gulf in the prefecture of Vaceniza . It shares a border with Ustonia to the west, and is also neighbored by Alastor , Grenneria , and Osun Tanum across the water to the north. Destrea is a highly developed country that possesses a large population, a massive industrial sector, extensive infrastructure, and a deeply troubled economy. Destrea is thought to have the world\u2019s largest and most formidable standing army, and is both renowned and feared for its many developments in land-based combat. It was governed by a stratocratic regime since its origins, but as the economy began to crash in early 1980, it quietly became a dictatorship when a high ranking officer gained huge popularity with the citizens by blaming Ustonia for their economic crisis and launching the Reclamation War . This newfound authoritarianism led to fascism, which bred rebellion, culminating in the rise of the Risky Witches , who dealt a sweeping, crippling blow to the regime on New Year\u2019s Day in 1991, now known as The Big Event . The country is still attempting to recover from this. History \u00b6 TBD Geography \u00b6 Destrea, due to its size, contains hugely varied topography. Through the heart of the country is a huge desert with flat, hilly, and mountainous regions within it. Surrounding the desert is a tropical savanna with forests to the far south, while to the north is a more temperate region, mostly grassland but forested in the far north. There is also a tropical forested archipelago in the southern gulf. Government & Politics \u00b6 Destrea is a despotic stratocratic regime, spearheaded by the commander-in-chief. It is unclear exactly how the commander-in-chief is given power, but their power seems to be supreme and incontestable. Administrative divisions \u00b6 Destrea is divided into 15 prefectures, each governed exclusively by the central military government with no autonomy. Each of these prefectures used to be a sovereign nation before ultimately becoming what is now Destrea, and their unique histories and cultures are still visible. These prefectures are as follows. Alcaras Baria Begliano Casezzo Espada Filimeni Monzione Mugenno Nalano Rovillo Savorra Selva Luce Tarence Vaceniza Military \u00b6 The Destrean military is divided into four branches, being Terra Militare, Marina Militare, Aeronautica Militare, and Militare Suprema. The Terra Militare branch is the world\u2019s largest and most formidable standing ground-based military force, while all branches combined are also the world\u2019s largest overall military force. While they can easily overwhelm with sheer numbers, their equipment and training among the air and naval forces lags slightly behind many other countries. Foreign relations \u00b6 Economy \u00b6 The Destrean economy is worth 1.12 quadrillion CR per year with an expenditure of 91.4%, which is distributed as follows. Administration: 10.6% Defense: 28.8% Education & Science: 6.2% Energy & Environment: 1.2% Food & Agriculture: 2.2% Healthcare: 5.6% Industry: 12.2% International Affairs: 2.4% Law & Order: 20.4% Social Policy: 4.3% Transportation: 3.3% Welfare: 2.8% The average income tax rate is 69.5%, and can reach up to 93% for the wealthy. There is a universal 22% sales tax applied to the sale of all goods other than food and drink. The average gap between the richest and the poorest citizens is fairly small, but the overwhelming majority of citizens are poor. Businesses are all publicly owned but subject to extreme regulation and control by the central government. Industry is fairly diverse with a particular focus on the military industrial complex. Some primary exports of Destrea are weapons manufacturing, heavy industry, and crude oil. Many exports and imports are both heavily restricted by the central government through prohibitive sale prices and import tariffs. The average import tariff on anything excluding essential goods is 36.1%, while essential goods follow the universal rate of the Yulentian Trade Union, being 1% for imports within the union and 4% outside of it. Demographics \u00b6 The Destrean government is extremely prejudiced against spirits and oppresses them heavily. Every spirit is required to carry a unique identifier card with them and renew it every year alongside their regular state identification, and violating this policy in any way can be punishable by death. Much of the public does not share these sentiments and instead views spirits with great pity, but still remain prejudiced in their own way because of this. Since the occupation of Espada by the Risky Witches, all records from that state were seized and are no longer accessible. There is an assumption that the actual spirit population is higher than records indicate due to that, the rebellion of 1991, and other criminal activity.

Education is compulsory under Destrean law for all children between 6 and 16 years of age, but the standards of education and the levels students are divided into are set by prefectural governments. Public schooling is tuition-free, but all other costs associated with the curriculum are the responsibility of the students and their families. The public school systems throughout the country are extremely underfunded and are often forced to assign more than double the usual amount of students to each teacher, and private schools, while widely available, are prohibitively expensive for most Destrean families. Both public and private schools place a strong emphasis on nationalism and Destrea-centric history that favors the military, and teaches - intentionally or not - that spirits are lesser beings compared to humans that deserve less. Homeschooling is technically regulated under prefectural law, but inspections are virtually never carried out so long as the students achieve satisfactory results on annual standardized tests. The Destrean educational system produces the worst average results in the world according to international test score surveys, but the top 10% of students tested often achieve similar scores to the international average. Health \u00b6 Healthcare in Destrea is offered universally as a public service through nationally owned and operated hospitals and clinics, but due to low capacities and long waiting times, a large private sector also thrives in Destrea, and is subject to very light regulation that ensures pricing does not exceed fair values, which are determined by an international regulatory body. Even with the regulated pricing, private healthcare is one of the largest contributors to debt throughout the Destrean population, while simultaneously operating most often with such small profit margins that private hospitals struggle to maintain and acquire modern equipment. The overall health of Destrean citizens is below average, due to many citizens being unable to receive the care they need in a timely or affordable manner, and widespread poverty causing increased rates of malnutrition and preventable disease.

Its capital, Norizgrad , is located in the heart of the country near the sea in the province of Roslaya . It is bordered by Corstaea and Osun Tanum , and is also closely neighbored by Destrea . Grenneria is a moderately developed country with a modest population, a troubled industrialized economy, and a modest military. Grenneria is credited for numerous developments in land-based combat strategy and tactics, as well as pioneering the use of gas-operated automatic rifles. However, troubling times befell the country in the early 20th century and greatly stunted their development, causing them to fall behind technologically. Their strategic prowess still shines despite their obsolete weaponry, allowing them to remain formidable in smaller scale land-based engagements. Alone, Grenneria is the weakest link of the Ozen Federation, and actively relies on it for aid in areas where the country falls short, but as part of a greater whole, they are still a vital element. For decades, the Grennerian government has often expressed distaste with the policies of the Ozen Federation, but carefully avoids becoming too troublesome under threat of ejection. Conversely, the Ozen Federation does not want to lose Grenneria and works to sustain their people and please their government without compromising the Federation. This delicate balancing act is a huge stressor on the whole Federation. History \u00b6 TBD Geography \u00b6 Grenneria is an almost entirely flat region with the exception of the lower half of Himlav\u00e5rd cutting through it. The whole region is forested with a temperate climate to the south, a boreal climate through the center, and tundra to the north and surrounding the mountains. Government & Politics \u00b6 Grenneria is an electocratic federal republic, split into two branches. The first branch, the Grennerian Administration, is led by a Prime Minister and at least one Deputy Prime Minster. Beneath them are many Ministers dedicated to specific departments of government, such as agriculture, defense, education, and so on. Citizens elect Ministers from a pool of candidates recommended by the Deputy Prime Ministers, and elect Deputy Prime Ministers from a pool of candidates recommended by the Prime Minister. Citizens can also elect a President, who is technically not part of the Administration, but is the one responsible for appointing the Prime Minister. The second branch, the Grennerian Council, is an independent entity formed to monitor the activities of the Administration and ensure that they are carried out in a timely manner and in accordance with the constitution. The President is the head of this organization and is responsible for appointing everyone in it, ultimately leaving much of the country\u2019s governance in a shadowy gray zone. This model garners much criticism, but you will be hard pressed to find a Grennerian citizen voicing such criticism in their own country. Administrative divisions \u00b6 Grenneria is divided into eight provinces, each overseen by at least one minister per department of the Administration. The provinces are governed exclusively by the Administration and have no autonomy, though they all have very distinct history and culture. These provinces are as follows. Ivashni Khotka Kielda Markask Nazavat Roslaya Sarabey Ulavyr Military \u00b6 The Grennerian military is divided into four branches, being the Ground Forces, Navy, Air Force, and Airborne Troops. Their naval and air forces are small, weak, and rather poorly trained and equipped, but their ground forces, while still being rather poorly equipped compared to the rest of the world, receive world-class training. The Airborne Troops branch was created to fill a strategic gap to the best of the country\u2019s ability by making use of the weak air forces to drop elite ground units directly into advantageous positions in battle. Foreign relations \u00b6 Economy \u00b6 The Grennerian economy is worth 112.7 trillion CR per year with an expenditure of 61.2%, which is distributed as follows. Administration: 9.6% Defense: 14.7% Education & Science: 7.8% Energy & Environment: 3.6% Food & Agriculture: 5.9% Healthcare: 7.4% Industry: 12.5% International Affairs: 5.9% Law & Order: 9.5% Social Policy: 6.3% Transportation: 8.9% Welfare: 7.9% The average income tax rate is 30%, and is much higher for the wealthy, though that doesn\u2019t tell the whole story as the minimum amount of income a citizen must make before being taxed is relatively high. There is a universal 17.5% sales tax on all luxury purchases applied by the Ozen Federation, called the OMT or Ozen Maintenance Tax. The average gap between the richest and the poorest citizens is rather small, but both extreme ends of the spectrum are immensely far apart. A large portion of business and industry is government owned and centrally planned, but the majority of businesses are privatized and allowed to follow the market economy. Corporate taxes are quite high and are prohibitive for most entrepreneurial individuals, but not too much to drive away big business. There is also known to be an expansive black market throughout the country, but further details are not available. Some primary exports of Grenneria are manufacturing, unskilled labor, and lumber. Grenneria relies in part on imports to sustain the country, and applies import tariffs ranging from nothing to 40% depending on the goods and from where they were imported, and applies no tariffs to any goods imported from within the Ozen Federation. Demographics \u00b6 Grenneria has historically acted towards spirits with total ignorance, and continues to do so today. The government operates as though spirits don\u2019t exist at all, leading to severe systemic discrimination against them. On top of this, many Grennerian people treat spirits as objects of fascination more than individuals. It is assumed that the spirit population of the country is very small as a result, but there is no concrete information to investigate this. Education \u00b6 Education in Grenneria is provided primarily by public schools, which are tuition-free and provide all required educational materials, appropriate clothing or uniforms, and lunches to their students free of charge regardless of economic status. The Grennerian system is divided into four levels, being preschool education (ages 6 and under), primary general education (ages 6 to 10), basic general education (ages 11-16), and secondary general education (ages 17-18). Private schools exist, but are strictly regulated and are rare as a result. Private schools are only legally permitted to operate if they provide a significantly unique alternative method of education that has been proven to produce satisfactory results. Families below a certain threshold of economic status are entitled to financial grants from the Ozen Federation to allow them to select a private school if they wish. Education standards are set by the Minister of Education and their board of advisors, with additional input from other ministers every five years to determine if there is any need for increased or reduced focus on things like economics, vocational education, military history, and politics. Students may also elect independently to enroll in post-secondary education of various types, from vocational schools to universities. The Grennerian educational system produces poor results, with 4th, 8th, and 12th grade students consistently being ranked 8th in international test score surveys, but it has been noted that these surveys may be a flawed representation of the Grennerian model, as Grennerian students are typically high achievers in their chosen fields but underachievers in most other fields. Health \u00b6 Healthcare in Grenneria is provided universally to all citizens of the Ozen Federation, primarily through nationally owned and operated hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies, all of which are paid with tax revenue and therefore do not charge patients at all for any care they receive. Privately owned alternatives exist, but are legally required to be operated as non-profit businesses and are subject to extreme regulation to ensure that all patients of any economic status can receive equal levels of care, with the Ozen Federation providing financial support to those that cannot afford the allowed charges from these businesses.

The Grennerian educational system produces poor results, with 4th, 8th, and 12th grade students consistently being ranked 8th in international test score surveys, but it has been noted that these surveys may be a flawed representation of the Grennerian model, as Grennerian students are typically high achievers in their chosen fields but underachievers in most other fields.","title":"Education"},{"location":"Nova-Regna/World/Map/Grenneria/Grenneria/#health","text":"Healthcare in Grenneria is provided universally to all citizens of the Ozen Federation, primarily through nationally owned and operated hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies, all of which are paid with tax revenue and therefore do not charge patients at all for any care they receive.

Its capital, Avalon , is the colossal building in the center of the country that vertically connects the land. Being less than half a century old, Ilmaria has very little history to fall back on, but has already made history globally several times by being the first man-made landmass of its kind, the largest construction project ever undertaken, the first country to achieve a nationwide negative carbon footprint, and the home of numerous groundbreaking inventions and innovations. Not only that, but Ilmaria has also quickly become a post-industrial economic powerhouse, providing countless services for the rest of the world. It is believed by many to be the first time in history that true utopia has been achieved, but many citizens of Ilmaria will debate that, stating that despite the incredible reality of a country that provides its citizens with everything they need to survive free of charge, the true cost is immense and unseen oppression and exploitation. These claims continue to be dismissed by most unaffected people and remain unproven on the international stage. 11K is headquartered in Avalon, the corporation also acting as the national government. A small but elite private military is maintained by 11K for defense and national security purposes exclusively, alongside defense contracts with both Shinzen and Ustonia to deter and repel any potential attempts at invasion. History \u00b6 TBD Geography \u00b6 As an entirely man-made landmass, Ilmaria has an almost entirely urban topography. It is most famously known for its two-tiered structure, with nearly half the area of the country being elevated 40 stories, and for the colossal building in the center of the nation that reaches from the very bottom of the landmass to 3.22 kilometers (2 miles) above sea level. There are dense forests along the lower edge of the country with plenty of flora and fauna carefully maintained throughout the rest of the country, with heavy usage of hydroponics. The climate is tropical and experiences the same seasonal effects as the natural land surrounding the country. Government & Politics \u00b6 Ilmaria is an oligarchy run by only a small handful of elite 11K employees. Originally installed by both Ustonia and Shinzen during the formation of the country, many of the original leaders have either been replaced or forced out behind the scenes, both to decrease the number of people sharing power and so 11K could monopolize the total influence to themselves. Administrative divisions \u00b6 Ilmaria is divided in two vertical tiers of land, each governed independently. The lower level, Nova , is an incredibly dense city accounting for over 70% of the population, most being laborers living in poverty. The upper level, Ventura , is a spacious and beautiful utopia populated almost exclusively by the wealthy and privileged. The colossal building in the center of the nation known as Avalon is a third independently governed region, serving as the national capital, albeit with a fraction of the population of Ventura. Military \u00b6 The military force of Ilmaria is a national guard comprised entirely of a privatized force controlled by 11K. They are equipped with cutting edge technology imported from both Shinzen and Ustonia and receive world class defense training, making them quite formidable to fight against in their home country but too small to have effective offensive capability. They are primarily trained to defend key points of the country, such as its structure, power generation, vital production, and so on. Further bolstering the defensive capability of the nation are defense contracts with both Shinzen and Ustonia, effectively giving Ilmaria the defensive strength of two global superpowers. It also conveniently functions as an insurance policy to prevent either Shinzen or Ustonia from attempting to claim control over the country, as neither is willing to fight the other. Foreign relations \u00b6 Economy \u00b6 The Ilmarian economy is worth 1.76 quadrillion CR per year with an expenditure of 13.6%, which is distributed as follows. Administration: 13.1% Defense: 4.9% Education & Science: 19.5% Energy & Environment: 3.6% Food & Agriculture: 4.2% Healthcare: 17.1% Industry: 4.2% International Affairs: 2.4% Law & Order: 4.1% Social Policy: 4.9% Transportation: 12.2% Welfare: 9.8% The income tax rate is a flat 11.6%. To supplement this by utilizing the power of the almost entirely automatic tax system, a variable sales tax ranging from 0% to 100% is applied to purchases as deemed necessary by the system\u2019s algorithms, depending primarily on the income and assets of the buyer, and all interest or dividends generated by liquid assets are automatically taxed by up to 50% depending on wealth. Additionally, every transaction is rounded up to the next zero after tax is added, with the difference also being collected. The gap between the richest and the poorest citizens is unfathomably large. Businesses are entirely privatized and enjoy extremely lax regulations in exchange for moderately high corporate taxes, while entrepreneurial individuals are given the opposite arrangement with very low taxes but moderately restrictive regulation. Since 11K acts as the central government of Ilmaria, the goods and services of 11K are all counted as the overwhelming majority of national exports, primarily in the information technology sector. Ilmaria applies import tariffs ranging between 0.5% and 18% depending on the goods, and from where they were imported, on top of the standard Yulentian Trade Union tariff of 1% on luxuries from within the union, and 4% outside of it. Demographics \u00b6 Ilmaria is the second most welcoming towards spirits , second only to Alastor . There is no systemic discrimination whatsoever beyond simple identification, and societal discrimination is rare to see and minimal in effect, mostly coming in the form of innocent fascination from people who have never seen a spirit before. Spirit population according to state records: 804,434 Cat: 503,252 Wolf: 3,104 Mouse: 11,637 Deer: 4,146 Chameleon: 5,230 Shark: 1,224 Crow: 302 Fox: 503 Others: 275,036 Education \u00b6 Education in Ilmaria is universal and entirely free of charge for all people in the country, regardless of status, while also being entirely privatized. All schools are privately owned and operated, and receive compensation at fair market rates through Ilmaria\u2019s automated tax system. These schools are permitted to set their own curriculums, methods, and schedules, provided they produce satisfactory results in annual standardized testing. Most schools in Ventura place disproportionate focus on science and art related courses, while most schools in Nova place disproportionate focus on work ethic and practical skills for entry level employment. The Ilmarian educational system produces average results, with 4th, 8th, and 12th grade students consistently being ranked 5th in international test score surveys. Health \u00b6 Healthcare in Ilmaria is universal and entirely free of charge for all people in the country, regardless of status, while also being entirely privatized. All hospitals, clinics, pharmacies and so on are privately owned and operated, and receive compensation at the fair market rate through Ilmaria\u2019s automated tax system. These facilities are some of the best equipped in the world with extremely well trained doctors and surgeons in high supply. Despite the apparent quality of the medical services offered in Ilmaria, the overall health of Ilmarian citizens is average. Residents of Ventura receive world-leading preventative care, but residents of Nova receive only reactionary care in response to symptoms and injuries.

Its capital, Grendelholt , is located in the center of the country near the sea in the state of Sonderg\u00e5rd . It is bordered by Corstaea , Grenneria , and Ustonia , and is also closely neighbored by Alastor and Destrea . Osun Tanum is a well developed country with a modest population, a weak but stable post-industrial economy, and a small but very well outfitted military. Osun Tanum is famously recognized as the world\u2019s foremost leader in the aerospace sector with countless world-first records to their name, including being the first to fly, first to exit the atmosphere, first to successfully deploy a satellite, and first to land on the moon. They also were the primary contributor to the Global Space Platform , and are currently developing a space elevator. All the while, their in-atmosphere developments are also second to none. Pilots trained in Osun Tanum are near-universally at the top of their class, and many of the finest aircraft in the world of many different varieties come from the country as well. Osun Tanum\u2019s model of social democracy is considered the global benchmark of efficiency and fairness, and their welfare, healthcare, and education programs are remarkably far ahead of the rest of the world. It is the only country in the world to have solved the problems of homelessness and unemployment. While Osun Tanum still has numerous problems, its citizens are the happiest and healthiest in the world. The country has remained non-aggressive to a fault, even losing over 80% of their territory to Ustonia during their time of rampant expansionism, and allowing them to retain a portion of it during peace negotiations. History \u00b6 TBD Geography \u00b6 Osun Tanum is an almost entirely temperate region with forests throughout most of it, several large rivers, and a fairly equal distribution of flatlands and rolling hills. Himlav\u00e5rd runs across much of the northern border of the country. Government & Politics \u00b6 Osun Tanum is a democratic federal republic with a unique mixture of political systems across the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, having both a presidential system and a parliamentary system simultaneously. It\u2019s a highly complex system and can be confusing to foreigners, but has been highly optimized and made efficient through centuries of use. As participation is so important to the system and representation is so high, policies grew simpler and easier to understand, political education was drastically improved, and adaptations were made to keep the public as well and fairly informed as possible. As a result, while a foreigner will likely be confused by the complex layers and many civic responsibilities, you can count on any native citizen of Osun Tanum to be both well educated and informed, and well equipped to act with that in mind. Administrative divisions \u00b6 Osun Tanum is divided into six states, each with their own state government overseen by an elected governor with limited autonomy under the federal government, along with a set of elected parliamentary representatives. Each state has their own unique history and culture, which greatly influences legislature. These states are as follows. Elg\u00e5rd Kolg\u00e5rd Macdon Osterfeld Sonderg\u00e5rd Vastdal Military \u00b6 The military of Osun Tanum is divided into four branches, being the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Home Guard. Their numbers are small, particularly in the navy, but they are very well trained and equipped. Osun Tanum also prides itself on having the best trained air force in the world, with many of their pilots being capable of downing aircraft a generation newer than their own. The only nation that stands a chance against Osun Tanum in the air is Shinzen with their highly competitive training plus advanced aircraft. More than any other nation, Osun Tanum is extremely dedicated to international peacekeeping efforts, often deploying so many of their forces that the Home Guard branch is necessary just to prevent leaving the country defenseless. Foreign relations \u00b6 Economy \u00b6 The economy of Osun Tanum is worth 133.4 trillion CR per year with an expenditure of 39.8%, which is distributed as follows. Administration: 10.3% Defense: 5.7% Education & Science: 14.2% Energy & Environment: 7.9% Food & Agriculture: 3.8% Healthcare: 11.6% Industry: 3.3% International Affairs: 8.3% Law & Order: 7% Social Policy: 7.3% Transportation: 6% Welfare: 14.6% The average income tax rate is 55%, but can be as low as 5.25% for low income taxpayers, and the wealthy are taxed in various other ways rather than with a higher income tax rate. There is a universal 17.5% sales tax on all luxury purchases applied by the Ozen Federation, called the OMT or Ozen Maintenance Tax. The average gap between the richest and the poorest citizens is fairly small. Many essential services such as education, welfare, healthcare, and other such things are federally owned and provided at little to no charge, while all other business is privatized and strictly regulated to prevent monopolies and unfair dealing. Corporate and business taxes are variable according to the size of the business, creating as level of a playing field as possible. Some primary exports of Osun Tanum are aerospace technology, wine, and organic foods. Osun Tanum applies import tariffs ranging from 1% to 12% depending on the goods imported from any country outside of the Ozen Federation, and no tariffs within it. Demographics \u00b6 Osun Tanum has a very high population of spirits and is extremely welcoming towards them, largely following in the footsteps of Corstaea to raise awareness and acceptance as well as reduce discrimination. However, the country has not gone so far as to remove spirit identification from the census entirely, like Corstaea has done, much to the delight of statisticians the world over. Spirit population according to the 2030 census: 19,614,205 Cat: 7,447,121 Wolf: 1,523,872 Mouse: 8,325,399 Deer: 239,743 Chameleon: 21,674 Shark: 45,925 Crow: 7,223 Fox: 1,731 Others: 2,001,427 It is suspected that there are many more spirits than this in the country, but it is impossible to verify. Many spirits are known to hide their identity on paper, hide it completely from everyone, or go so far as to live off the grid out of either fear or preference. Education \u00b6 Education in Osun Tanum is provided primarily by public schools, which are tuition-free and provide all required educational materials, appropriate clothing or uniforms, and lunches to their students free of charge regardless of economic status. The Tanish school system is typically divided into three levels, being elementary (grades 1-7), lower secondary (grades 7-10), and upper secondary (grades VG1-VG3). Elementary and lower secondary education are compulsory under Tanish law. Private schools exist, but are strictly regulated and are rare as a result. Private schools are only legally permitted to operate if they provide a significantly unique alternative method of education that has been proven to produce satisfactory results. Families below a certain threshold of economic status are entitled to financial grants from the Ozen Federation to allow them to select a private school if they wish. Education standards, including the preferred methods and schedules used in public schools, are managed collaboratively between the Tanish government and student representatives of all ages from all six states, leading to Tanish students spending less time in schools than students anywhere else in the world, the abolishment of homework, and significant reductions in time spent on common courses, instead favoring a wide range of courses focused on real-world skills. The educational system of Osun Tanum produces the best results in the world according to both international test score surveys and independent short and long term surveys of student happiness. Health \u00b6 Healthcare in Osun Tanum is provided universally to all citizens of the Ozen Federation, primarily through nationally owned and operated hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies, all of which are paid with tax revenue and therefore do not charge patients at all for any care they receive. Privately owned alternatives exist, but are legally required to be operated as non-profit businesses and are subject to extreme regulation to ensure that all patients of any economic status can receive equal levels of care, with the Ozen Federation providing financial support to those that cannot afford the allowed charges from these businesses. The overall health of Tanish citizens is excellent.

Its capital, Dangje , is located in the center of the country on the main island. It is closely neighbored by Shinzen to the south, separated by a large strait. Sangyon is a highly developed country with a small but incredibly dense population, a reasonable post-industrial economy, extensive infrastructure, and a small but well outfitted military kept exclusively for defensive purposes. Sangyon is known most famously for its beautiful, lush, undisturbed landscapes, balanced in delicate harmony with its massive, bustling city centers, making the country a global tourist favorite. It is also considered one of the world leaders in the development of robotics, microelectronics, artificial intelligence, and biotechnology, in close competition with Shinzen despite its incredible disadvantages in population and spending power. Even in times of war, the country has always remained optimistically focused on furthering its research of peaceful technologies for the benefit of its citizens, and enjoys its resulting reputation as a shining beacon of peace and progress, reflected in their flag today. History \u00b6 TBD Geography \u00b6 Sangyon is divided fairly equally into a temperate rainforest in the south, boreal forest in the north, and temperate seasonal forest in the middle. The topography is mostly flat with some shallow hills. The most unique aspect of Sangyon\u2019s geography is in the water, as it is surrounded by all three of the world\u2019s oceans, plus many beautiful and unique oceanographic features, and is home to a very diverse underwater ecosystem. Government & Politics \u00b6 Sangyon is a unitary republic under constitutional monarchy, in which the power of the Emperor is limited to ceremonial and symbolic capacities. Executive power is instead wielded by the Prime Minister of Sangyon and the Cabinet. The country follows a remarkably similar system of government as Shinzen, as it was Shinzen that assisted in the reformation of the government of Sangyon, but it has been adapted to fit the needs of the country by minimizing inefficient bureaucratic divisions and departments, instead placing more power directly into the hands of Parliament, most obviously being their structure as a unitary state rather than a federation. Administrative divisions \u00b6 The country is divided into 16 prefectures, many of which are their own islands or archipelagos. These prefectures are controlled by the central government with no autonomy, instead having a set of locally elected representatives to petition the central government on issues. These states are as follows. Cheosu Dangje Gangsu Gwasu Haesu Jeonsan Kimje Kimsong Manjin Ranan Rasan Rawang Sinju Tanbaek Tanje Wonsan Military \u00b6 The military of Sangyon, better known as the Republic of Sangyon Armed forces or ROSA, is divided into three main branches, being the Army, Navy, and Air Force. They are technologically one generation behind the rest of the world and are incredible few in numbers, but are well trained for defense operations. Foreign relations \u00b6 Economy \u00b6 The economy of Sangyon is worth 119.3 trillion CR per year with an expenditure of 38.1%, which is distributed as follows. Administration: 13% Defense: 1.2% Education & Science: 21.5% Energy & Environment: 12.1% Food & Agriculture: 2.1% Healthcare: 9.9% Industry: 6.2% International Affairs: 3.1% Law & Order: 7.4% Social Policy: 3.1% Transportation: 6.8% Welfare: 13.6% The average income tax rate is 20.9%. It reaches up to 44% for the wealthy, and as low as 6% for low income taxpayers. There is a flat 10% sales tax on all goods and services sold, excluding certain exceptions, such as educational materials. The average gap between the richest and the poorest citizens is moderate, and the majority of citizens are middle class. Many scientific and educational institutions are state owned, along with most welfare and social services, but the vast majority of business is privatized and strictly regulated to prevent monopolies and unfair dealing, as well as to protect the surrounding environment and enforce emissions standards. Corporate taxes are high, but there are a wealth of tax credits available as rewards for various things such as carbon neutral operation, providing equal opportunities, conducting valuable research, and so on. The largest contributor to the economy of Sangyon is the tourism industry, but some other significant contributions include the export of research, robotics, and fish. Sangyon applies import tariffs ranging between 1.2% and 22% depending on the goods, and from where they were imported. Demographics \u00b6 Sangyon experiences nearly the opposite problem as Shinzen regarding spirit acceptance. Systemic discrimination is nonexistent and spirits technically have absolute equality with humans in the country, but societal discrimination still runs rampant as many people are overly wary based on outdated ideas, old stories, and xenophobia. A happy spirit is a rare sight in Sangyon. Spirit population as of the 2030 census: 7,075,287 Cat: 4,835,200 Wolf: 741,253 Mouse: 192,236 Deer: 712,412 Chameleon: 125,231 Shark: 13,687 Crow: 11,102 Fox: 7,432 Others: 436,734 It is suspected that there are many more spirits than this in the country, but it is impossible to verify. Many spirits are known to hide their identity on paper, hide it completely from everyone, or go so far as to live off the grid out of either fear or preference. Education \u00b6 Education in Sangyon is provided primarily by public schools, but private schools are a popular choice among richer families. Education is compulsory for children between 7 and 18 years of age, but many families choose to enroll their children in nursery schools as early as 1 year of age, and the vast majority of students pursue four or more years of post-secondary education. Over 95% of students also attend private cram schools to supplement their education. All education within the compulsory age range is tuition-free, both in public and private schools, and any required educational materials and appropriate clothing or uniforms are provided free of charge, but students are responsible for purchasing or supplying their own food. Public schools offering education to students outside of the compulsory range charge a nationally regulated tuition fee, and private schools are free to set their tuition fees as they please. Standards for students, teachers, and schools are higher in Sangyon than anywhere else in the world, with students being expected to achieve scores that would be considered above average in most of the world merely to pass, teachers being required to complete six or more years of university education majoring in the type of education they wish to provide, and schools being subject to regular inspections to ensure they are properly maintained. The education system of Sangyon produces excellent results, with 4th, 8th, and 12th grade students consistently being ranked 2nd in international test score surveys, as well as the highest percentage of university graduates in the world. However, there is significant pressure, both from within Sangyon and internationally, to relax the educational standards of the country, citing extremely poor mental health among students from the overwhelming workload and expectation to succeed, authoritarian teachers and schools, a lack of student rights, systemic stigmatization of vocational education leading to an abundance of over-educated people that causes many less \u201cprestigious\u201d job openings to be very difficult to fill, and poor physical health among students due to the neglect of physical education in favor of over-emphasis on classroom based education. Health \u00b6 Healthcare in Sangyon is universal, though a significant portion of it is privately funded. Citizens of Sangyon with income beyond certain thresholds are required to pay proportional contributions towards the national health insurance service both to insure themselves and their families, and to help make it possible for patients in worse economic situations to receive equal care entirely free of charge. The overall health of the citizens of Sangyon is excellent, and the country\u2019s healthcare system is consistently ranked as the best in the world in patient satisfaction, efficiency, and quality of care.

Its capital, Hangjing , is located in the extremely mountainous heart of the country in the Qihua territory. It is encircled by a land border with Shinzen . Shaohou is a poorly developed country with a modest population, a deeply troubled economy with massive agricultural and industrial sectors, poor infrastructure, and a large but poorly outfitted military. Shaohou is also known for its extreme restrictions on both civil rights and political freedoms, and for its incredibly cheap manufacturing and engineering labor exports. Bitter rivals with Shinzen since time immemorial, Shaohou dedicated itself almost entirely to defeating Shinzen for centuries - even during times of peace - ultimately holding back the development of the country drastically. While Shinzen continued to dominate and eventually adopted a peaceful ideology, Shaohou never moved beyond its militaristic imperial ideology or its corrupt dynasties, and continues to stagnate as a result. History \u00b6 TBD Geography \u00b6 Shaohou contains extremely varied topography despite its size, with nearly every non-arctic biome other than the boreal forest being visible in the country, along with everything from vast flatlands to the second tallest mountain in the world. Government & Politics \u00b6 Shaohou is a dynastic absolute monarchy, also bordering on military rule as different dynasties squabble for power. The Emperor holds absolute power and stands above the law. Beneath the Emperor are three departments and six ministries to handle their respective areas of governance on behalf of, but still subject to supervision and approval from the Emperor. The Department of Chancellery controls the Ministry of Personnel, responsible for civil affairs, and the Ministry of Revenue, responsible for the management of the economy. The Department of State Affairs controls the Ministry of Rites, responsible for interior affairs, foreign relations, and ceremonial affairs, and the Ministry of Defense, responsible for management of the military. Finally, the Secretariat controls the Ministry of Justice, responsible for judicial and penal affairs, and the People\u2019s Ministry, responsible for management of infrastructure and state-owned production and manufacturing. Administrative divisions \u00b6 The country is divided into six territories, all under the control of the ruling dynasty. These territories are as follows. Nanjiang Qihua Suwei Xinshu Xinwei Yuezou Military \u00b6 The Shaohan military, better known as the People\u2019s Protection Army or PPA, is divided into three primary branches, being the PPA Ground Forces, PPA Navy, and PPA Air Force. While its army is comparatively large, the vast majority of it is in the Ground Forces, and the entire military is one to two full generations behind the rest of the world, both technologically and in training, as a direct result of the country\u2019s centuries of stagnation. Foreign relations \u00b6 Economy \u00b6 The economy of Shaohou is worth 84.2 trillion CR per year with an expenditure of 83.4%, which is distributed as follows. Administration: 16.4% Defense: 18.5% Education & Science: 5.6% Energy & Environment: 4.5% Food & Agriculture: 6.7% Healthcare: 7.6% Industry: 13.2% International Affairs: 0.6% Law & Order: 14% Social Policy: 4.3% Transportation: 6.1% Welfare: 2.5% The average income tax rate is 61.7%, and much higher for the wealthy, though the ruling dynasty is exempt. There is no sales tax, and no tax on liquid assets. The gap between the richest and the poorest citizens is virtually nonexistent, excluding the ruling dynasty and other powerful dynasties, which are all unfathomably richer than the rest of the population. Nearly all businesses providing essential goods and services are state owned, and nearly all businesses providing non-essential goods and services are privately owned, but exceptions exist on both sides. The corporate tax rate is a flat 25% regardless of size or income, and all businesses are extremely heavily regulated to follow the centrally planned economy. Some primary exports of Shaohou are unskilled labor, manufacturing, and agricultural products. Shaohou applies import tariffs ranging between 1% and 10% depending on the goods, and from where they were imported. Demographics \u00b6 Shaohou is extremely prejudiced against spirits , systemically and societally, leading to extreme oppression in addition to the already great challenges associated with living under Shaohan rule. Accurate statistics are not available for spirit population even though it is known that the country keeps track of them. Education \u00b6 Education in Shaohou is provided primarily by a state-run public school system which is managed by the People\u2019s Ministry. All citizens must attend school for a minimum of nine years of compulsory education, which is funded by the government and typically includes six years of primary education between 6 and 12 years of age, followed by three years of junior secondary education. The following three years of senior secondary education are not compulsory, but most students still complete senior secondary education. Post-secondary education was once also funded by the government, but today students must compete for scholarships based on their academic achievements to be able to enroll. The Shaohan educational system has historically been poor, but today produces slightly below average results, with 4th, 8th, and 12th grade students ranking 6th in international test score surveys and slowly improving further with every survey. Many believe that this sudden improvement in educational performance can be attributed to the drastic reduction in state-centric and anti-Shinzen material included in courses, and by imitating aspects of the Ustonian model. Health \u00b6 Healthcare in Shaohou utilizes both public and private medical institutions and insurance programs, and is offered in two parallel forms, one for modern medicine and one for traditional medicine. Despite over 95% of the Shaohan population having at least basic health insurance coverage, the majority of people of below average economic status still cannot afford the costs they are responsible for to receive modern medicine under the current system, leading many insured people to go without care, or to choose traditional medicine as a more affordable alternative despite its unproven and unscientific nature and lack of verifiable results. The overall health of Shaohan citizens is very poor.

Its capital, Takagawa , is located near the southern coast of the state of Asahi . It is bordered by Shaohou to the west, and closely neighbored by Sangyon to the northwest and Ilmaria in the eastern gulf. Shinzen is a highly developed nation with the second largest population in the world, a booming semi-industrial economy, and a very well outfitted military. Shinzen is also considered to be one of the world leaders in aviation and automotive engineering, as well as development in space travel, robotics, microelectronics, artificial intelligence, and biotechnology. History \u00b6 Nothing for now. History of Shinzen for later. Geography \u00b6 Well over half of Shinzen is covered in dense, untouched forests, rolling hills, and mountains. The whole country minus the state of Kenshiri has a tropical climate. Rivers are extremely prevalent in the country and even flow directly through many cities. Shinzen is also home to the most diverse ecology in the world, and is revered for its natural beauty. Government & Politics \u00b6 Shinzen is a federal republic under constitutional monarchy, in which the power of the Emperor is limited to ceremonial and symbolic capacities. Executive power is instead wielded by the Prime Minister of Shinzen and the Cabinet. Administrative divisions \u00b6 The country is divided into 11 states, each with their own state government overseen by an elected governor with some degree of autonomy under the federal government, most with their own unique cultural views that influence their legislation. These states are as follows. Asahi Futou Hayagawa Kenshiri Kiyoshiri Kuminachi Miwae Okina Onsai Sumitori Tozawa Military \u00b6 The Shinzenese military, better known as the Shinzen Regional Defense Forces or SRDF, is divided into three primary branches, being the Ground Force, Maritime Force, and Air Force. What they lack in numbers, they make up for with cutting edge technology and training that is second to none, and their particular emphasis on aviation has led them to have the world\u2019s most formidable air force. Foreign relations \u00b6 Economy \u00b6 The economy of Shinzen is worth 2.25 quadrillion CR per year with an expenditure of 24.8%, distributed as follows. Administration: 2.8% Defense: 3.1% Education & Science: 19.3% Energy & Environment: 6.4% Food & Agriculture: 1.3% Healthcare: 21.1% Industry: 1.8% International Affairs: 7.8% Law & Order: 6.1% Social Policy: 6.3% Transportation: 3.8% Welfare: 20.2% The average income tax rate is 23%. It reaches up to 55% for the wealthy, and as low as 9% for low income taxpayers. There is a flat 10% sales tax on all goods sold except food, which is 8%, and there is a road tax determined by miles traveled each year, fully automatically. The average gap between the richest and the poorest citizens is moderate, but both extreme ends of the spectrum are incredibly far apart. All infrastructure, educational institutions, social services, and welfare organizations are state owned, while all other businesses are privatized, but all primarily follow the market economy alongside a contingency plan managed by the state. The corporate tax rate is a fixed 10.9% plus separate duties or penalties depending on the type of business and how it\u2019s structured and managed. Some primary exports of Shinzen are electronics, cars and trucks, and biotechnology. Shinzen applies import tariffs ranging between 4.7% and 41% depending on the goods, and from where they were imported. Demographics \u00b6 Shinzen has a unique struggle with acceptance of spirits , as their official stance is a welcoming one and most people in the country are openly accepting and supportive of spirits, but systemic discrimination still remains, particularly in education and career opportunities. Nevertheless, many spirits are quite happy with their treatment in Shinzen, even though they have fewer opportunities. Spirit population as of the 2030 census: 14,158,605 Cat: 8,312,945 Wolf: 121,004 Mouse: 243,211 Deer: 4,298,433 Chameleon: 550,753 Shark: 73,231 Crow: 9,199 Fox: 13,423 Others: 536,406 It is suspected that there are many more spirits than this in the country, but it is impossible to verify. Many spirits are known to hide their identity on paper, hide it completely from everyone, or go so far as to live off the grid out of either fear or preference. Education \u00b6 Education in Shinzen is provided primarily by public schools, but private schools are a popular choice among richer families. Education is compulsory under federal law at elementary (1st-6th grade) and lower secondary (7th-9th grade) levels, but the vast majority of students still pursue upper secondary (10th-12th grade) education. Many schools offer two or more levels of education in the same building, but some still offer only one. Public education is tuition-free, and any required educational materials and appropriate clothing or uniforms is provided free of charge, but students whose families are above a certain income level are required to either purchase or supply their own lunches. Education standards are set nationwide by the Ministry of Education, which encourages achievement and success in education through the use of semi-competitive testing, displaying the test scores of students in the main halls of schools twice annually. Test scores are the primary qualification required to enter public post-secondary education, which most students choose to attempt. Many students also choose to enroll in private cram schools to prepare for university entrance exams. In anonymous independent surveys of students, over 70% of students say that they feel the workload of the current education system is extremely stressful and harmful to their mental health, and that they feel they have to deal with the stress silently to avoid reprimand. The Shinzenese educational system produces excellent results, with 4th, 8th, and 12th grade students consistently being ranked 3rd in international test score surveys. Health \u00b6 Healthcare in Shinzen is a hybrid of public and private systems, with many hospitals and pharmacies being run as for-profit businesses, and a universal health insurance program provided to all citizens by the federal government, as well as the option of purchasing supplemental private insurance through an employer or from a local government. Patients are responsible for up to 30% of their medical expenses, with extensive financial assistance options available for poor patients. The overall health of Shinzenese citizens is excellent.

Its capital, Northfair , is located near the west coast in the northwestern state of Arkbay . It is bordered by Destrea to the east and Osun Tanum to the north, also closely neighbored by Alastor to the northeast. Ustonia is a highly developed country with the world\u2019s largest population, a thriving semi-industrial economy, and an incredibly well-outfitted military thought to be elite in all aspects. Ustonia is also considered one of the world leaders in engineering, as well as military development, production, and training, and enjoys sweeping success in exporting these goods and services in particular. Ustonia held aggressive expansionist ideologies for a time and annexed many territories, most notably including a significant portion of Osun Tanum. Many wars were caused as a direct result of Ustonia\u2019s aggressive nature, eventually leading the people to grow weary and adopt a much more peaceful ideology through the Mistletoe Revolution of 1972, rescinding most of their annexations in the process. The only annexed areas from this time that have not been rescinded are Isla Sofia , West Vastdal , and South Macdon . History \u00b6 Ustonia is the second youngest new nation in the world, being less than 400 years old as we know it, even before its formation. The overwhelming majority of the Ustonian population today is of Exilan descent, but the entire continent of Yulentia was populated almost exclusively by the Cirazan peoples prior to the settling of three colonies from nations in Ozen ; With the assistance of the people of Torstr\u00f8m to navigate the sea, the colony of Roxware was settled by people of Manden , the colony of Centralia was settled by people of Hartmond , and the colony of Gravenwood was settled by people of Osterfeld . The people of Torstr\u00f8m spoke only in their native language for all three of the long voyages - from planning to landfall - despite the vital importance of effective communication with the crew and settlers, which led to the Exilan settlers adoption of their language. In 1973, the states of Prestona and Verace defected from Destrea and declared to the world that they would become part of Ustonia instead. Ustonia, while they did not know of this in advance, shocked the world by immediately annexing the states in response and stationing an overwhelming military force along their borders to deter Destrean aggression. This action is still a subject of heated debate around the world, and was even used by Destrea to justify the Reclamation War , but is generally believed to have been an acceptable action. Geography \u00b6 Ustonia, due to its size, contains highly varied topography, but is largely quite flat. In the southern heartlands of the country is a large desert, surrounded by a tropical savanna with forests along the coast. Further north is a large grassland, followed by temperate forests in the northwest of the country. Ustonia also controls the remote tropical island of Isla Sofia, home to a uniquely thriving rainforest. Government & Politics \u00b6 Ustonia is a democratic federal republic, spearheaded by an executive branch led by an elected president and vice president, and supported by a cabinet of advisors, alongside congress in the legislative branch and the supreme court in the judicial branch. Every branch of the government is subdivided into several smaller, increasingly specific departments, and struggles with a lot of bureaucratic inefficiencies and miscommunications as a result. Administrative divisions \u00b6 The country is divided into 19 states, each with their own state government overseen by an elected governor with some degree of autonomy under the federal government, most with their own unique cultural views that influence their legislation. These states are as follows. Aldbell Alraine Arkbay Buxwin Corburn Exford Isla Sofia Lonfolk Morwick Norston Orness Oxbalt Prestona South Macdon Stonesea Talles Venfair Verace West Vastdal Military \u00b6 The Ustonian military is divided into six primary branches, being the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Air Force, and Star Corps. While Destrea maintains a larger standing army, Ustonia prides itself on being better trained and better equipped while still remaining competitive on sheer size. Foreign relations \u00b6 Economy \u00b6 The Ustonian economy is worth 1.98 quadrillion CR per year with an expenditure of 17.3%, which is distributed as follows. Administration: 12.5% Defense: 30.1% Education & Science: 6.3% Energy & Environment: 1% Food & Agriculture: 2.2% Healthcare: 5.2% Industry: 9.4% International Affairs: 5.2% Law & Order: 8.3% Social Policy: 5.2% Transportation: 11.2% Welfare: 3.4% The average income tax rate is 14.5%, spread across seven tax brackets, ranging from 10% for the lowest income to 37% for the highest income taxpayers. There is no federal sales tax, but some states within the country choose to apply their own sales taxes, ranging from 4.5% to 9.85% where present. The gap between the poorest and the richest citizens is immense, but the overwhelming majority of citizens are working class. Certain essential services such as welfare workers and public education are split between federal and state ownership, but the overwhelming majority of businesses in Ustonia are privatized and follow the market economy. Corporate and business regulations and taxes are very low, encouraging many foreign businesses to incorporate in Ustonia, and many citizens to attempt entrepreneurship, which has led to widespread hustle culture and a deeply rooted gig economy. Some primary exports of Ustonia are military equipment and training, plastics, and snack foods. Ustonia applies import tariffs ranging between 0.85% and 31% depending on the goods, and from where they were imported, on top of the standard Yulentian Trade Union tariff of 1% on luxuries from within the union, and 4% outside of it. Demographics \u00b6 The official stance the Ustonian government holds on spirits is one of welcoming and acceptance, but in practice things don\u2019t quite match up. While spirits aren\u2019t legally oppressed in Ustonia, they still face serious systemic and societal discrimination in day to day life, and often have to work several times as hard as most humans to maintain a positive reputation, good grades, career standing, and so on.

Many spirits are known to hide their identity on paper, hide it completely from everyone, or go so far as to live off the grid out of either fear or preference. Education \u00b6 Education in Ustonia is provided in public and private schools and by individuals through homeschooling, typically starting with kindergarten for kids between 5 and 6 years of age, followed by 1st to 12th grades for kids between 6 and 18 years of age, divided into three levels, being elementary, middle, and high school, which are each typically offered in separate schools. Patriotism is encouraged in most curriculums through the practice of pledging allegiance to the Ustonian flag, spending a disproportionate amount of time studying a curated version of Ustonian history, and annual demonstrations and/or recruitment drives from the national military. State governments set their own education standards, and the federal government mandates standardized tests for K-12 public school systems. While public schools are tuition-free, students and their families are still responsible for the costs of their own educational materials, lunches, all costs associated with elective courses, and appropriate clothing or uniforms. Post-secondary education in Ustonia is prohibitively expensive for most Ustonians, and is among the largest sources of debt throughout the population. Education is compulsory under federal law, but neither the federal government nor state governments offer alternatives to poor families who cannot afford the necessary items or food. Many poor families who turn to homeschooling find it to be extremely stressful, as homeschooled students are subject to additional testing, up to four times as frequently as otherwise, and are often also subject to home inspections, especially if the family has a spirit in the household. The Ustonian educational system produces below average and continuously declining results, with 4th, 8th, and 12th grade students recently falling to the rank of 7th in international test score surveys, overtaken by Shaohou. Health \u00b6 Healthcare in Ustonia is entirely privatized, with hospitals and pharmacies usually being run as for-profit businesses. Citizens are required under federal law to purchase health insurance, which is also a for-profit industry in Ustonia that still leaves many citizens open to large medical bills. For citizens federally classified as living in poverty, state funded insurance plans are provided by local governments at reduced rates, but typically offer limited care. Mental health care is extremely underfunded and rarely covered by insurance, causing most citizens to be forced to wait months to get the help they need, or simply never attempt to get it at all. Equality of access is not mandated by law, and patients can be denied care for a multitude of reasons. Due to the largely unregulated for-profit structure of the medical and insurance industries in Ustonia, prices for care and pharmaceuticals are grossly inflated up to 2500% higher than what has been deemed fair internationally, causing medical expenses to be the largest source of debt throughout the Ustonian population. The overall health of Ustonian citizens is below average, notably displaying the highest obesity rate in the world.

The overwhelming majority of the Ustonian population today is of Exilan descent, but the entire continent of Yulentia was populated almost exclusively by the Cirazan peoples prior to the settling of three colonies from nations in Ozen ; With the assistance of the people of Torstr\u00f8m to navigate the sea, the colony of Roxware was settled by people of Manden , the colony of Centralia was settled by people of Hartmond , and the colony of Gravenwood was settled by people of Osterfeld . The people of Torstr\u00f8m spoke only in their native language for all three of the long voyages - from planning to landfall - despite the vital importance of effective communication with the crew and settlers, which led to the Exilan settlers adoption of their language. In 1973, the states of Prestona and Verace defected from Destrea and declared to the world that they would become part of Ustonia instead. Ustonia, while they did not know of this in advance, shocked the world by immediately annexing the states in response and stationing an overwhelming military force along their borders to deter Destrean aggression. This action is still a subject of heated debate around the world, and was even used by Destrea to justify the Reclamation War , but is generally believed to have been an acceptable action.","title":"History"},{"location":"Nova-Regna/World/Map/Ustonia/Ustonia/#geography","text":"Ustonia, due to its size, contains highly varied topography, but is largely quite flat.

They present themselves primarily as a revolutionary group seeking independence, but also offer their services as private military contractors and security professionals. They are headquartered at Presidia de la Bruja in the Espada prefecture of Destrea , and also control Presidio de Tibur\u00f3n in the Nalano prefecture. They are known globally for their extraordinary military strength, rumored to be capable of turning the tides of battle while outnumbered ten to one, and are most infamously known for carrying out The Big Event . They lean heavily into their reputation by choosing to mobilize the smallest force possible for most operations. Because of this, the intimidation factor can be so great when they do rarely mobilize a large force that their enemies may sometimes surrender entirely without a fight. Because of their strong focus on the protection of spirits and marginalized humans, the Risky Witches emblem is seen as a symbol of hope for many of those people. At the same time, many people loyal to their countries or ignorant of the issues the Risky Witches call attention to see their emblem as a symbol of death and suffering due to the frightening military prowess they flaunt. Structure \u00b6 While the Risky Witches are not affiliated with any other governmental entities, they are structured in largely the same standard fashion as the regular armies of the world with eight Enlisted ranks (E-1 - E-8), and eight Officer ranks (O-1 - O-8), though they have no need to distinguish between commissioned, non-commissioned and warrant officers. Instead, becoming an Officer is accomplished by merit alone, only needing to prove oneself capable and be willing to fill the role. The rank of O-8, Grand Marshal, is only held by Freya, though there isn\u2019t any official record of her existence within the group. Most members of the Risky Witches only know of her existence and authority through legend or description, foreign entities are given false information if they inquire, and the general public only knows stories and rumors. Since she has the ability to monitor the entire world all at once, she\u2019s always informed, but since she\u2019s not particularly interested in personally running an entire military herself, she hand picks the Field, Air, and Sea Marshals and distributes information through them. On the rare occasion she personally takes control, it\u2019s usually to turn the tide of battle in her favor, as her direct control can increase effective strength to that of a force five times their size, or to the point of being virtually undefeatable with the assistance of Haida to facilitate instant telepathic communication with key operatives. Freya and Haida are also both members of Task Force 5555 along with Garm , Dvalinn , Kuhai , and Neven . No official record of any of them - or even their unit - exists, but their existence is nevertheless known to members of the Risky Witches. Outside the unit, all of the incarnations aside from Freya hold the effective rank of O-6, and everyone else holds the effective rank of O-5. The hierarchy within the unit is informal at best and a disorganized mess at worst. Army \u00b6 The Army branch of the Risky Witches is split into three primary, two secondary, and three special divisions. The three primary divisions are Infantry, Artillery, and Armor. The Infantry division is comprised entirely of typical foot soldiers, sometimes equipped with light armored personnel carriers. The Artillery division is a combined arms division focused on very heavy weaponry, most often deployed to support other units or to lay siege to fortifications. The Armor division is a combined arms division focused on tank and armored cavalry units, most often deployed for all-out offense. The two secondary divisions are Aviation and Defense. The Aviation division is comprised entirely of offensive helicopter units, while the Defense division is comprised of a mixture of Infantry, Artillery, Armor, and Aviation units, trained specifically to defend against significantly larger forces. The three special divisions are Shock, Night, and Combat Search and Rescue. These divisions are all comprised of only the highest performing soldiers from the primary divisions. The Shock division is trained specifically to surprise and overwhelm the enemy with the goal of wiping them out or capturing a target before they can sufficiently react to the attack, while the Night division is essentially the same but trained to carry out their operations optimally at night, and the Combat Search and Rescue division focuses on piercing enemy lines to recover lost or downed allies.

Air force \u00b6 The Air Force branch of the Risky Witches is split into three divisions. The 1st Division is dedicated entirely to air superiority. It is comprised of 1st Wing \u201cLanza\u201d, focused on maximum offensive power and maneuverability, and 2nd Wing \u201cJavelin\u201d, specializing in long range deployments. The 2nd Division is comprised of 3rd Wing \u201cChaparr\u00f3n\u201d and 4th Wing \u201cSilver Wind\u201d, both multirole wings focused on short and long range deployments respectively, similar to the 1st Division. The 3rd Division is comprised of 5th Wing \u201cPepita\u201d, a reserve wing dedicated to training and demonstration operations. It is also home to 49th Wing \u201cGhost\u201d, but the existence of this wing is classified as top secret.

Navy \u00b6 The Navy branch of the Risky Witches is split into three sections. The Surface section is comprised of two fleets, a close range assault force including the flagship aircraft carrier \u201cKestrel\u201d, and a long range strike force including the flagship aircraft carrier \u201cIntervenci\u00f3n\u201d. The Submarine section is comprised of two fleets, a naval superiority force including the flagship submarine \u201cGhost Eater\u201d, and a classified long range reconnaissance force. The Auxiliary section is comprised of three fleets, a rescue and patrol force, a long range support and transport force, and a classified special operations force.

Special forces \u00b6 The Special Forces branch of the Risky Witches is comprised of the hand picked elite from all three combat divisions, dedicated entirely to irregular warfare and high priority target recovery or acquisition. Nearly everything within this branch is classified as top secret. They number approximately 3,600 personnel and supply their own equipment, including aircraft, but rely on the special operations fleet for naval operations. The branch is also home to two unique divisions. Task Force 1743, Irregular Security (ISEC) is a unit classified as top secret, known at most by name only to all but a select handful of high ranking individuals. Their influence is global, and as such their numbers are impossible to ascertain. They operate in the shadows, outside of international law, and always accomplish their mission no matter the cost. Nothing is off limits for them. Task Force 5555, \u201cParty Regiment\u201d is an all weather, day and night shock unit comprised of the pinnacle of the elite, trained for absolute superiority both on the ground and in the air, led personally by Freya and the Incarnations . While the unit is technically classified to prevent vital information from leaking, the name and strength of this unit is well known to all of the Risky Witches and is a huge morale booster. Part of the nickname comes from that fact, as simply hearing that the unit is joining the battle causes effective allied strength to surge. The other reason for the nickname is from the extreme freedom enjoyed within this unit, leading to a lot of highly unprofessional activity, like frequent wild parties. They have their own dedicated armory and a large, extremely varied aircraft inventory, all sporting distinctive paint jobs. None of their equipment is counted in the official statistics of the organization. They number 328 personnel, and all but three of them have both alignment and attunement. The exceptions are Garm and Kuhai, who lack alignment, and Nikolai Anatolyevich Litvyak , who lacks both abilities. Non-combatants \u00b6 To keep the Risky Witches functioning, a number of non-combat roles are essential. There are approximately 8,500 non-combatants spread as needed through six distinct departments. Some combat mission orders come from these departments, be it for defense, conflict resolution, hired support, or otherwise. Internal Affairs \u00b6 Tasked with top level administration and governance, including legislation and economics. Political Affairs \u00b6 Tasked with negotiation and diplomacy with foreign powers and private companies as needed, as well as the management of tasks related to the goal of establishing independence as a free nation. Supply Chain Management \u00b6 Tasked with everything related to the supply chain, including buying and selling smuggled goods. Intelligence \u00b6 Tasked with acquiring, managing, archiving, and distributing intelligence as needed. Espionage \u00b6 A classified department tasked with subterfuge, blackmail, and acquiring high value intelligence. Cyber Ops \u00b6 A classified department dedicated to cybersecurity, cyber warfare, and providing services for hire. Public Agenda \u00b6 Immediately after The Big Event in 1991, what remained of the Destrean government declared the Risky Witches terrorists, to which the Risky Witches responded by addressing the public to reveal the amount of civilian casualties caused by Destrea during The Big Event, prove that none of said civilian casualties were caused by the Risky Witches, and re-state their objectives: To become independent from the tyranny of Destrean regime, by any means necessary. To protect all marginalized people, be they spirit or human, no matter the consequences. To stand against tyranny and oppression around the world, no matter the cost. To never allow the killing of even one innocent person under our watch. To crush all who oppose us, all who oppose our allies, and all who oppose their own people. Since then, this agenda has not changed, but the group has moved from a proactive approach to Destrean hostilities to a reactive one. Independence \u00b6 While the Risky Witches are in total control of the Espada prefecture of Destrea, and are known specifically in international politics as the Revolutionary State of Espada, they stake claims on much more territory than just Espada. The provinces of Tarence , Mugenno , Baria , and Selva Luce are included in their demands to Destrea, along with the western third of Nalano, continuing Espada\u2019s border southeast where it intersects. They claim that these parts of Destrea have the highest relative proportions of spirit population, poverty, homelessness, disability, and general unmet needs among the people, including recognition of ancestral rights and cultural identities, and that liberating and subsequently uniting these areas under a new flag is necessary to end the oppression. When asked anonymously and off the record, people in those areas - particularly in Selva Luce - seem to be in full support of the group, but are afraid of what could happen to them if they express that publicly. The people who lacked that fear have reportedly already defected and fled to Espada. Some international politicians that support the group believe that this lofty goal is the largest obstacle before Espada\u2019s freedom, even calling it a more complicated issue than their war against Destrea and the crimes they have committed, both in said war and separately as a PMC. The Risky Witches themselves report that the only reason they have not yet taken the areas they demand is because they don\u2019t have the resources needed to effectively and safely care for the people in those areas, and lack the numbers to spread their military strength so thin while Destrea is still able to constantly attack Espada, so they intend to crush the Destrean forces entirely through attrition before taking the land and bolstering their strength. When asked why they only seek to claim the west of Nalano when they currently are in control of Presidio de Tibur\u00f3n in the east, representatives of the Risky Witches responded saying that they will continue to control that area, and they are only doing it because it\u2019s close to the Destrean capital, Syrres , which keeps the Destrean leadership as angry and irrational as possible. Revolution \u00b6 The secondary objective of the Risky Witches is to incite revolution within Destrea by empowering the rebellion engaged in the current civil war wherever possible. The group\u2019s current strategy to gain independence lines up with this goal, as both the Risky Witches and the Destrean rebels are working to dramatically weaken the Destrean military and leadership. While the Risky Witches have no desire to overthrow the Destrean government themselves, as they would rather separate entirely, the group is also unwilling to overlook the current fascist regime and have stated that while they are in full support of the rebellion, another \u201cbig event\u201d could happen if the revolution has not succeeded by the time the group has achieved their primary goal of independence. The Risky Witches also stand to directly benefit from a successful Destrean revolution carried out by allies of the group, but have not confirmed nor denied whether or not this matters to them. Assets \u00b6 They hold control over the whole Espada prefecture, as well as Presidio de Tibur\u00f3n in the Nalano prefecture. Their armaments, while mostly bought or taken from Ustonia and Destrea, are a mixture of things from every country, especially among the Special Forces division where individual soldiers and pilots are given extra freedom to choose their preferred equipment. The majority of their armaments are two or three generations behind current, with small portions of both newer and older technology mixed in. They also have an in-house weapons manufacturing plant, world renowned gunsmiths, and expert aircraft engineers and mechanics. Chances are if you can imagine it, they probably have it, and if they don\u2019t have it, they can make it for the right price. Some, but not all, of the many weapons in service, roughly in order of prominence, are: Pistols Beretta 92FS Beretta PX4 Storm Compact Benelli B76 CZ 75 B/BD Smith & Wesson M&P Pardini GT9 Boberg XR9S (Primary carry for all vehicle/equipment operators and field engineers, and concealed carry for special forces and non-combatants) FN Five-seveN (Available for special forces when required, either unsuppressed with AP rounds or suppressed with subsonic rounds.

They are listed here with their real-world names for convenience and will be updated eventually. Perhaps most notably, they are also in possession of the Nagase X-0 Dauntless prototype fighter aircraft, presumed to be nuclear capable, but its whereabouts and operational status are unknown. Food, water, and other necessities \u00b6 The entirety of the Espada prefecture is a desert. There is no farmable land, no area suitable for raising farm animals, and water is scarce. Before the Risky Witches took control, the area was entirely reliant on imports from other parts of the country, but those supply lines have all been cut off. The Risky Witches receive some supplies from Ustonia as part of their regular arms deals through a heavily guarded supply line running through the Tarence prefecture, and occasionally receive air dropped supplies from Alastor and Osun Tanum. These supplies are not enough to support the organization on their own, however, so the Risky Witches regularly steal from the Destrean military, both on defensive and offensive operations. Sources of revenue \u00b6 The Risky Witches, despite striving to become an independent free nation, do not have any form of self sustaining economy. Instead they are entirely reliant on income sourced outside of their borders. They offer services as private military contractors and as security professionals on the public market, and are frequently hired by the governments of Ustonia, Grenneria, Shinzen, as well as private individuals around the world. They also export contract labor on weapons and aerospace manufacturing and design, cybersecurity, heavy-lift air cargo transport, air medical services and evacuation, and both civilian and military flight instruction. Less publicly, the Risky Witches are also frequently hired by various governments in secret to carry out illegal military operations, assassinations, and espionage behind enemy lines, and by private individuals for hits ranging from intimidation to assassination. These illegal operations bring in approximately 40% of their total revenue, not because of frequency, but because of absurdly high prices. A notable portion of their income is stolen from the Destrean government, be it by simply taking cash they find, planned highway robberies, wire fraud, scams, or cybercrime. The smallest source of regular revenue for the group comes from various nature and wildlife preservations around the world that require protection from poachers and hostile trespassers. Some members of the Risky Witches are exported as full time park rangers that work below market rate, and among them, some are unpaid volunteers. History \u00b6 The origins of the Risky Witches began ten years before their official establishment. At this time, Freya was the flight commander of the Witch Squadron , a Destrean multirole fighter squadron that was infamous for their lethality and unpredictable nature, and had a negative reputation with the Destrean military due to repeated insubordination that proved unresolvable through standard disciplinary action. Rather than continue trying to discipline the unit or force them to disband, the Destrean military opted to send the Witch Squadron into increasingly dangerous operations, leading to the losses of several pilots. Already not afraid to reject authority, Freya and those remaining in her unit took this treatment as an opportunity. During an operation in 1981, Freya was shot down deep inside enemy territory and reported that she could not eject, then just before impact, ordered her squadron to ignore all other orders and withdraw. Upon landing, the unit was immediately grounded and placed under surveillance by the base commander, and their planes were reassigned to another unit. The entirety of the Witch Squadron mourned the loss of Freya, but days later, she walked into the dormitory alive and wielding a revolver, shot the supervisor in front of her squad mates, and deserted with them. Word spread quickly about the 131 rebels, and their infamy grew explosively. This small group spent the next year carrying out clandestine raids on small Destrean military bases and transports both to supply themselves with arms and to recruit more soldiers to their rebellion, increasing their numbers from 131 to over 1,000. Among these recruits was a 9 year old Garm found being used as a living weapon by a Destrean officer. After the discovery of Garm, the group transitioned away from raiding to instead focus on spreading propaganda for their cause and building their strength through intensive training, while Freya tracked down and recruited the rest of the incarnations, Dvalinn, Haida, Kuhai, and Neven. Over the next nine years, their numbers ballooned even further, surpassing 15,000 rebels. The vast majority of these rebels were trained to a level that could be considered elite among the elite. On new year\u2019s day in 1991, the Risky Witches made their presence officially known to the world by carrying out The Big Event , seizing Espada, and broadcasting their agenda on national television. In 1998, the Risky Witches joined the Reclamation War after a Shinzenese air force test pilot stole and escaped with the Nagase X-0 Dauntless prototype fighter. The pilot intended to do whatever she could to stop the Destrean operatives from carrying out their plan to steal the Nagase aircraft and use them against Ustonia, but she herself was branded a traitor and an enemy in the process, both by Shinzen and Ustonia, but the Risky Witches trusted her and brought her to their headquarters. With her help, the Risky Witches engaged and destroyed all other stolen Nagase aircraft before they had the opportunity to do critical damage, then exited the conflict. Foreign relations \u00b6 As a paramilitary group not officially recognized as a state or nation, foreign relations take on a unique tone with the Risky Witches as leaders and diplomats fear the potential implications of relations with them. Most contact is handled unofficially as a result, perpetuating a \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d attitude regarding the Risky Witches in the international community. Alastor Shortly after their establishment in 1991, the Risky Witches issued an international statement swearing to defend Alastor from all threats under any circumstances. In return, the Risky Witches are the only foreign entity allowed to pass freely through Alastor territory as they please, and Alastor provides them whatever support they can offer as needed. Corstaea Corstaea remains neutral towards the Risky Witches, having no need for their services and no reason to offer them support. The feeling is mutual. Destrea Obviously, they are sworn enemies. There is no repairing the relationship between the Risky Witches and Destrea, not without a total revolution by the Destrean people. Grenneria Grenneria is of the opinion that the Risky Witches are terrorists, but isn\u2019t brave enough to publicly denounce them. Relations are very passive aggressive as a result. Ilmaria While Ilmaria has turned a blind eye to the Risky Witches, the Risky Witches have a keen interest in Ilmaria as an enemy. They just need an excuse to attack. Osun Tanum Osun Tanum is cautious towards the Risky Witches, but fully support their goal of independence. The Risky Witches are cautiously optimistic regarding Osun Tanum as they are in full support of their policies and cultural treatment towards spirits and those with attunement, but neither offers services nor accepts support from them due to the possible consequences for Osun Tanum. Sangyon Sangyon is very wary of the Risky Witches because they know their military strength cannot compare. However, the Risky Witches have no issue with Sangyon and regularly offer their services at discounted rates. Shaohou Shaohou, as a friend to Destrea, shares their hostile opinion against the Risky Witches, but not quite to the same degree. Relations are still possible between the two, though under extreme tension. Shinzen Shinzen has a very negative opinion of the Risky Witches as they are highly opposed to war. However, the Risky Witches have no issue with Shinzen, so tensions may be high but they amount to nothing. Ustonia As Ustonia had negative relations with Destrea already, they seized an opportunity when the Risky Witches formed and formed a pact. Ustonia provides the Risky Witches with supplies and arms regularly in return for a heavy discount on their services and mutual defense when called for. Trivia \u00b6 The name \u201cRisky Witches\u201d is silly, and they all know it. During their time as rebels, a name for their group was never considered, but when one was suddenly needed, nobody had any ideas. When discussing The Big Event, a young Garm commented that the operation was very risky. Freya joked about it. The group ran with it, and the joke became their name.

Instead, becoming an Officer is accomplished by merit alone, only needing to prove oneself capable and be willing to fill the role. The rank of O-8, Grand Marshal, is only held by Freya, though there isn\u2019t any official record of her existence within the group. Most members of the Risky Witches only know of her existence and authority through legend or description, foreign entities are given false information if they inquire, and the general public only knows stories and rumors. Since she has the ability to monitor the entire world all at once, she\u2019s always informed, but since she\u2019s not particularly interested in personally running an entire military herself, she hand picks the Field, Air, and Sea Marshals and distributes information through them. On the rare occasion she personally takes control, it\u2019s usually to turn the tide of battle in her favor, as her direct control can increase effective strength to that of a force five times their size, or to the point of being virtually undefeatable with the assistance of Haida to facilitate instant telepathic communication with key operatives. Freya and Haida are also both members of Task Force 5555 along with Garm , Dvalinn , Kuhai , and Neven . No official record of any of them - or even their unit - exists, but their existence is nevertheless known to members of the Risky Witches. Outside the unit, all of the incarnations aside from Freya hold the effective rank of O-6, and everyone else holds the effective rank of O-5. The hierarchy within the unit is informal at best and a disorganized mess at worst.","title":"Structure"},{"location":"Nova-Regna/World/Organizations/Risky%20Witches/#army","text":"The Army branch of the Risky Witches is split into three primary, two secondary, and three special divisions. The three primary divisions are Infantry, Artillery, and Armor. The Infantry division is comprised entirely of typical foot soldiers, sometimes equipped with light armored personnel carriers. The Artillery division is a combined arms division focused on very heavy weaponry, most often deployed to support other units or to lay siege to fortifications. The Armor division is a combined arms division focused on tank and armored cavalry units, most often deployed for all-out offense. The two secondary divisions are Aviation and Defense. The Aviation division is comprised entirely of offensive helicopter units, while the Defense division is comprised of a mixture of Infantry, Artillery, Armor, and Aviation units, trained specifically to defend against significantly larger forces. The three special divisions are Shock, Night, and Combat Search and Rescue. These divisions are all comprised of only the highest performing soldiers from the primary divisions. The Shock division is trained specifically to surprise and overwhelm the enemy with the goal of wiping them out or capturing a target before they can sufficiently react to the attack, while the Night division is essentially the same but trained to carry out their operations optimally at night, and the Combat Search and Rescue division focuses on piercing enemy lines to recover lost or downed allies.

These supplies are not enough to support the organization on their own, however, so the Risky Witches regularly steal from the Destrean military, both on defensive and offensive operations.","title":"Food, water, and other necessities"},{"location":"Nova-Regna/World/Organizations/Risky%20Witches/#sources-of-revenue","text":"The Risky Witches, despite striving to become an independent free nation, do not have any form of self sustaining economy. Instead they are entirely reliant on income sourced outside of their borders. They offer services as private military contractors and as security professionals on the public market, and are frequently hired by the governments of Ustonia, Grenneria, Shinzen, as well as private individuals around the world. They also export contract labor on weapons and aerospace manufacturing and design, cybersecurity, heavy-lift air cargo transport, air medical services and evacuation, and both civilian and military flight instruction. Less publicly, the Risky Witches are also frequently hired by various governments in secret to carry out illegal military operations, assassinations, and espionage behind enemy lines, and by private individuals for hits ranging from intimidation to assassination. These illegal operations bring in approximately 40% of their total revenue, not because of frequency, but because of absurdly high prices. A notable portion of their income is stolen from the Destrean government, be it by simply taking cash they find, planned highway robberies, wire fraud, scams, or cybercrime. The smallest source of regular revenue for the group comes from various nature and wildlife preservations around the world that require protection from poachers and hostile trespassers. Some members of the Risky Witches are exported as full time park rangers that work below market rate, and among them, some are unpaid volunteers.","title":"Sources of revenue"},{"location":"Nova-Regna/World/Organizations/Risky%20Witches/#history","text":"The origins of the Risky Witches began ten years before their official establishment. At this time, Freya was the flight commander of the Witch Squadron , a Destrean multirole fighter squadron that was infamous for their lethality and unpredictable nature, and had a negative reputation with the Destrean military due to repeated insubordination that proved unresolvable through standard disciplinary action. Rather than continue trying to discipline the unit or force them to disband, the Destrean military opted to send the Witch Squadron into increasingly dangerous operations, leading to the losses of several pilots. Already not afraid to reject authority, Freya and those remaining in her unit took this treatment as an opportunity. During an operation in 1981, Freya was shot down deep inside enemy territory and reported that she could not eject, then just before impact, ordered her squadron to ignore all other orders and withdraw. Upon landing, the unit was immediately grounded and placed under surveillance by the base commander, and their planes were reassigned to another unit. The entirety of the Witch Squadron mourned the loss of Freya, but days later, she walked into the dormitory alive and wielding a revolver, shot the supervisor in front of her squad mates, and deserted with them. Word spread quickly about the 131 rebels, and their infamy grew explosively. This small group spent the next year carrying out clandestine raids on small Destrean military bases and transports both to supply themselves with arms and to recruit more soldiers to their rebellion, increasing their numbers from 131 to over 1,000. Among these recruits was a 9 year old Garm found being used as a living weapon by a Destrean officer. After the discovery of Garm, the group transitioned away from raiding to instead focus on spreading propaganda for their cause and building their strength through intensive training, while Freya tracked down and recruited the rest of the incarnations, Dvalinn, Haida, Kuhai, and Neven. Over the next nine years, their numbers ballooned even further, surpassing 15,000 rebels. The vast majority of these rebels were trained to a level that could be considered elite among the elite. On new year\u2019s day in 1991, the Risky Witches made their presence officially known to the world by carrying out The Big Event , seizing Espada, and broadcasting their agenda on national television. In 1998, the Risky Witches joined the Reclamation War after a Shinzenese air force test pilot stole and escaped with the Nagase X-0 Dauntless prototype fighter. The pilot intended to do whatever she could to stop the Destrean operatives from carrying out their plan to steal the Nagase aircraft and use them against Ustonia, but she herself was branded a traitor and an enemy in the process, both by Shinzen and Ustonia, but the Risky Witches trusted her and brought her to their headquarters. With her help, the Risky Witches engaged and destroyed all other stolen Nagase aircraft before they had the opportunity to do critical damage, then exited the conflict.","title":"History"},{"location":"Nova-Regna/World/Organizations/Risky%20Witches/#foreign-relations","text":"As a paramilitary group not officially recognized as a state or nation, foreign relations take on a unique tone with the Risky Witches as leaders and diplomats fear the potential implications of relations with them. Most contact is handled unofficially as a result, perpetuating a \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d attitude regarding the Risky Witches in the international community. Alastor Shortly after their establishment in 1991, the Risky Witches issued an international statement swearing to defend Alastor from all threats under any circumstances. In return, the Risky Witches are the only foreign entity allowed to pass freely through Alastor territory as they please, and Alastor provides them whatever support they can offer as needed. Corstaea Corstaea remains neutral towards the Risky Witches, having no need for their services and no reason to offer them support. The feeling is mutual. Destrea Obviously, they are sworn enemies. There is no repairing the relationship between the Risky Witches and Destrea, not without a total revolution by the Destrean people. Grenneria Grenneria is of the opinion that the Risky Witches are terrorists, but isn\u2019t brave enough to publicly denounce them. Relations are very passive aggressive as a result. Ilmaria While Ilmaria has turned a blind eye to the Risky Witches, the Risky Witches have a keen interest in Ilmaria as an enemy. They just need an excuse to attack. Osun Tanum Osun Tanum is cautious towards the Risky Witches, but fully support their goal of independence. The Risky Witches are cautiously optimistic regarding Osun Tanum as they are in full support of their policies and cultural treatment towards spirits and those with attunement, but neither offers services nor accepts support from them due to the possible consequences for Osun Tanum. Sangyon Sangyon is very wary of the Risky Witches because they know their military strength cannot compare. However, the Risky Witches have no issue with Sangyon and regularly offer their services at discounted rates. Shaohou Shaohou, as a friend to Destrea, shares their hostile opinion against the Risky Witches, but not quite to the same degree. Relations are still possible between the two, though under extreme tension. Shinzen Shinzen has a very negative opinion of the Risky Witches as they are highly opposed to war. However, the Risky Witches have no issue with Shinzen, so tensions may be high but they amount to nothing. Ustonia As Ustonia had negative relations with Destrea already, they seized an opportunity when the Risky Witches formed and formed a pact. Ustonia provides the Risky Witches with supplies and arms regularly in return for a heavy discount on their services and mutual defense when called for.","title":"Foreign relations"},{"location":"Nova-Regna/World/Organizations/Risky%20Witches/#trivia","text":"The name \u201cRisky Witches\u201d is silly, and they all know it.

(1873-1941) Leader Darian Williams Headquarters Avalon Motto The Dreams of Kings 11K is a global conglomerate of conglomerates, the largest in the world. Not only is it far larger than any other multinational conglomerate on their own, 11K holds a significant stake in most of them. Its holdings are so huge and diverse that 11K finds a significant stream of revenue from nearly every sector of industry that exists, even owning the entirety of Ilmaria and acting as its de facto government. It is headquartered in Avalon . While many have rightful concerns about the existence of a company so large it can have a monopoly over an entire country, it cannot be denied that 11K has pushed the development of new technologies to an incredible speed. 11K can be directly credited with changing the very way of life of the entire world after the invention of SensNet , a lifestyle technology product that connects directly to the brain with an always-on internet connection anywhere in the world, has no need for batteries or recharging, has both augmented reality and virtual reality capabilities, and enables individuals to defy death with the breakthrough Sublimation technology. Assets \u00b6 11K has significant holdings in many companies in all major industries all over the world. A complete comma-separated list of the companies 11K is significantly invested in would be enough to fill a small book. Many people, even professional analysts, have largely given up on trying to keep track of the influence and activity of 11K, and it has become commonplace for people to assume that unless they know with absolute certainty that this is not the case, all of their products and services probably have some connection to 11K. 11K accounts for nearly 5% of the entire global economy in revenue alone, and substantially more when also considering the total revenue of all other companies of which they own significant holdings. Top industries: Electronics Information and communications Financial services Mass media Real estate Medical and pharmaceutical Public utilities Transportation Food and agriculture Advertising Software Construction Petroleum Waste management Retail Manufacturing Lawyers and law firms Education Entertainment Engineering History \u00b6 Originally formed as a mere partnership holding company called Anderson-Williams Co., the two men were shrewd and aggressive in their pursuit of wealth, investing hefty amounts in many businesses they saw potential in, buying others in their entirety, and even bribing some to dissolve entirely. Their methods in these early days were so close to criminal that they found themselves subject to investigation quite frequently, but they never actually committed any crimes. Their investments paid off impressively every time, and were swiftly invested into more and more diverse businesses, pioneering the conglomerate model. Over the years and as the company grew its influence exponentially, a small selection of companies had offered to work together or even merge with Anderson-Williams. By 1930, ten companies had become wholly owned subsidiaries of Anderson-Williams and over 30 other smaller companies had merged. Anderson and Williams had an ongoing disagreement over how to conduct their business for years, and in 1933, Williams went on the offensive and forced Anderson out of the company entirely by seizing his assets in truly criminal fashion. Law enforcement never took action on this matter because Williams had bought them already, and Anderson had no choice but to leave with nothing left. Williams had fallen ill a few years after that, and in 1940, he succumbed to his illness and was hospitalized. His youngest son, Darian Williams , succeeded him as head of the company as a dying wish. While many of the top executives had hoped to seize this opportunity to take over the business for themselves, they were shocked by how Darian was not only similar to his father, but even more business savvy. In only one fiscal year, the company assets doubled, and in 1941 the company was renamed to Eleven Kings (and later 11K) to represent the eleven directors of the company including Darian.

Concordia Type Corporation Founding date 1978 Leader Arlette Brunton Headquarters TBD Motto Lighting the Way Forward History \u00b6 Concordia as a public entity was established on April 26th, 1978 by Robert Brunton , his wife Arlette Brunton , Geraldine Dahlin , and Sigmun Hustad after Robert came up with a solution to providing constant, reliable energy to his parent\u2019s farm using a more efficient steam boiling and dispersion method, that he then patented and developed under the company name. The process was dependent on an little-understood material named Bosmite , an allotrope of Bismuth infused with mystic matter that allows adjoining fluids, such as air and water, to have higher heat capacities. After applying this discovery to a standard boiler heating system Robert realized he could use this to create a \u201ccold steam\u201d system that allowed for room temperature water vapor to be spread in mass quantities, improving irrigation systems wholesale.\u2003\u2003 The innovation alone generated millions in revenue allowing its founders to establish the farm and the surrounding area as an outdoor research facility. As the studying of Bosmite and mystic matter opened more doors of research and technologies, Concordia continued to further use its overwhelming gross income to vastly expanding its land and available facilities to the point where the lot itself became so large it was more efficient to develop housing, recreation, transportation, and other infrastructure on its campus, turning the once small family run farm into a modern urban bubble.\u2003\u2003 Since its early days Concordia has moved away from Bosmite enrichment as its focus and towards providing solutions to agricultural development. This has coincidentally led the company on the path of energy research and development as most of their customers come from second and third world nations where energy accessibility is the forefront bottleneck in food production.\u2003\u2003 In 2015 Robert passed away after a slow and steady decline in health over the past few years.

It is well known for its groundbreaking innovations in several fields, most notably in energy generation with the invention of the EVA Driver , a palm-sized device capable of powering a home with no fuel or byproducts, plus development of what are by far the world\u2019s most advanced artificial intelligence programs. While Hijiya products are a rare sight in most of the world, they\u2019re everywhere in their home country of Shinzen, where the company is a national icon celebrated for not just it\u2019s work and products, but also for both its extensive humanitarian efforts and its staunch dedication to remaining independent, never outsourcing work or selling to foreign companies like 11K and Concordia . Among past, current, and prospective employees, the company is also renowned for its highly considerate people-first attitude, making it one of only a handful of corporations in Shinzen that are not victim to the rampant workaholism of the country. Assets \u00b6 Known primarily for their EVA Drivers, Hijiya naturally owns a significant portion of the energy sector in Shinzen. However, beyond that public perception, Hijiya is actually much more focused on technological advancement and research, once being considered the world leader in their fields. While they still hold an overwhelming lead on the world in the field of artificial intelligence, their company was forced to make wide, massive cuts to their operations, leaving them in a position of relative struggle. While their total revenue is still massive, their profits are so minuscule that there is a quite significant risk of taking losses significant enough to require making further cuts to avoid bankruptcy if they meet too difficult of competition. In an attempt to mitigate that risk while also working back to their former glory, Hijiya has begun to diversify into new fields, most notably in finance, and also rents out most of its defunct office space. One unexpected venture for Hijiya, though, was their contract with a virtual idol group in Shinzen. Their prototype android, K-17 T0 , was scouted by the idol group during one of its video game livestreams, a form of media that had seen explosive growth in Shinzen that various idol groups capitalized on. K-17 T0\u2019s live streams from then on became a surprisingly significant source of not only revenue, but positive public reception and interest for the company, becoming the unofficial face of Hijiya among virtual idol fans. The company is currently exploring further investment into this field.

Kaede quickly revolutionized the company by establishing a technological research division, where he spent most of his time, and branching out into the energy and electronics fields. The company board had full confidence in Kaede\u2019s ability to manage the company despite his rare appearances at meetings, evidenced by the rapid growth of the company and his impeccable foresight. When he later married a woman named Hana and immediately gave her the position of chairman of the board, suspicions began to arise as his appearances became even less frequent, and even she regularly failed to appear for meetings. Only stressing matters further, for a few years, nearly all company profit was directed to the research division, the work of which was kept strictly secret to all but the people working in it. All suspicions and concerns were immediately dispelled in 1998 when both Kaede and Hana interrupted a meeting with the fruits of their labor: The EVA Driver prototype. After several demonstrations within the company, the technology was prepared for production and a dedicated department was formed in the energy division to further develop, manufacture, and maintain these devices. When they hit the market in 2000, the company became a global sensation virtually overnight, as they appeared to have just achieved the impossible: unlimited energy. Company growth was beyond explosive, and Kaede capitalized on it to the fullest potential, branching the company further into technological fields and focusing on research. With their laser focus, the company became the world leader in almost everything it researched and ran away with the lead, becoming impossible to compete with and forcibly pushing the world far forward. Hana also capitalized on this opportunity in her own way by leaving the company and returning to her previous job as neurosurgeon and neuroscience researcher, inadvertently bringing with her the support of the Hijiya Corporation as her husband dedicated a small branch of the company to provide services and sponsorship to her and her team. At this time, Kaede and Hana both also dedicated a portion of their time to humanitarian efforts throughout the country, helping build the Hijiya reputation into one that puts the people first. As the company continued to branch out, it also continued to struggle with its performance in the international market, as they were stuck behind an unbreakable international perception of the Hijiya Corporation as \u201cthe company that made the EVA Driver\u201d and couldn\u2019t bring enough awareness to their other products, even as they continued to push the boundaries of science. That was ultimately their downfall, when in 2016, the Hijiya family was involved in a lethal plane crash in a private plane made by their company, which was powered by an experimental EVA Driver. The only survivor of the crash was their five year old daughter Nozomi , though she was permanently crippled. News of this incident quickly became global news, and the company reputation tanked all around the world, devastating the company as their international market virtually dissolved within a week. However, their standing in Shinzen was largely unaffected, even slightly improved, as by this point the company had become a celebrated and treasured national icon. As the country mourned the loss of Kaede and Hana Hijiya, the company devoted itself almost entirely to developing far more advanced safety protocols for all EVA Drivers after the former head of the experimental research division, Minori Sakaguchi , was appointed as interim president. To stay afloat after the loss of their international market, several branches of the company were shut down entirely, including the majority of its research centers, and funding was decreased significantly for many others. While they still remained the world leader in some fields by quite a significant margin, it was a massive hit to morale as the company began to stagnate. Slowly but surely, without a visionary to lead the effort, they lost their lead in many fields as the world finally caught up to them. As Nozomi grew up, however, it became clear that she was most likely just as gifted as her parents, if not more, so morale began to increase again as they found a new hope for the future. Unfortunately, while she is the rightful heir to the company and has never resisted the idea of taking over, she has also never shown the confidence, charisma, and business savvy to fit the role, so it was decided to allow the interim president to remain until she was ready, though some company decisions are still brought to her for approval first out of respect. After her first public appearance on behalf of the company ended in her fainting and subsequently refusing to talk to anyone for a week, though, the prospect of her taking over was greatly diminished. Fortunately for her, the event wasn\u2019t televised, but people from the company treated her differently from then on. Company morale remains high since then, because despite losing the hope that Nozomi will soon take over the company and restore it to what it once was, she became something of a princess to them.

Notable car models: Lanza, Aquila, Paloma, Phoenix, Estela, Starcaster, Lovelace, Ridgeback Notable aircraft: Dealer, Decorator, Dancer, Debonair, Dawnbreaker, Duskwalker, Deadlock, Dauntless Notable spacecraft programs: Outlander, Strider, Tomoe Notable aircraft: These aircraft are all particularly notable because of their development. It wasn\u2019t known to anyone until it was too late that Destrean spies were heavily involved with Nagase during this time. After they were discovered, the prototypes of all but the Dauntless were stolen by Destrea. Several of these craft were astonishingly superior to anything else in the sky, so news of this happening led to an international state of emergency. Ustonia deployed a massive force to intercept, but were completely wiped out in the battle while the Destreans came out completely unscathed. Aside from the Dauntless, all of these aircraft were given codenames by Ustonia after that battle. Dealer (XS-63, S-63) The Dealer is a somewhat unassuming looking twin engine interceptor and precision bomber aircraft with a top speed of mach 3.6 and a cruising speed of mach 3.0 at 20km altitude, a service ceiling of 22km, and average maneuverability. Its namesake comes from its primary armaments, which are its devastating air-to-ground missiles that never missed a target during its first battle with Ustonia, and its high volume short-range omnidirectional air-to-air missiles. It entered production in 1989 and remains in service in Shinzen and Osun Tanum. Decorator (XS-64, S/B-64) The Decorator is a large and imposing looking twin engine fighter-bomber with a top speed of mach 1.7 and a cruising speed of mach 1.2 at 8km altitude, a service ceiling of 18km, and above average maneuverability. Its namesake comes from its overwhelmingly numerous omnidirectional MIRV missiles, capable of tracking both air and ground targets. It entered production in 1986 and remains in service in Shinzen and Ustonia, though the production version is only capable of half as many simultaneous targets as the prototype. Dancer (XS-61, S-61D) The Dancer is a very small, sleek, lightweight single engine air superiority fighter with a top speed of mach 2.2 and a cruising speed of mach 1.6 at 8km altitude, a service ceiling of 15km, and extreme maneuverability. Its namesake comes from its maneuverability, as it appeared to dance through the skies effortlessly during the battle with Ustonia, capable of outmatching four fighters at the same time. It carries a small amount of simple air-to-air missiles, no flares, and rather than a large caliber cannon, uses four medium caliber machine guns. Unlike all the other planes from this period, there were two prototypes made. It entered production in 1990 but was quickly retired after only four were built due to the extreme skill required to pilot effectively, as the numerous assistive technologies and advanced life support systems were not carried over from the prototypes due to cost. All four Dancers produced were disarmed and now tour the world as an air show demonstrator group. Debonair (XS-62, S-62E) The Debonair is the bigger brother of the Dancer, looking very much like a larger, longer version of it. It is a lightweight single engine electronic warfare fighter with a top speed of mach 2.5 and a cruising speed of mach 1.9 at 12km altitude, a service ceiling of 20km, and high maneuverability. Its namesake comes mostly from its appearance, and because it was never far from the Dancer during the battle with Ustonia. It is assumed it was conducting both electronic support for the Dancer and jamming everyone else. It carries a large amount of air-to-air missiles, flares, four unarmed jamming/surveillance drones, and a single large caliber cannon. It entered production in 1990 without its drones, and was reconfigured immediately after the retiring of the Dancers to increase its offensive effectiveness. It remains in service in Shinzen. Dawnbreaker and Duskwalker (XS-65A and XS-65B) These twin craft are midsize, twin engine air superiority fighters with a top speed of mach 2.8 and a cruising speed of mach 2.0 at 8km altitude, a service ceiling of 41km, and very high maneuverability. Their namesakes aren\u2019t explained, so they probably came from raw fear and awe, coming from the fact that they look like nothing else in the sky and are armed like nothing else as well. Both craft are equipped with gauss guns rather than traditional cannons. Dawnbreaker is also equipped with a devastating retractable railgun and high speed air-to-air missiles, and Duskwalker with a retractable laser beam cannon and onboard missile jammers. They were never put into production. Deadlock (X-1) The Deadlock is the culmination of all the previous craft, a large, imposing, alien looking, triple engine (twin turbojet, single ramjet) all purpose fighter with a top speed of mach 5.1 and a cruising speed of mach 2.8 at 8km altitude, a service ceiling of 96km, and maneuverability that nearly defies the laws of physics. This craft was never seen during the battle with Ustonia, and it is only known to exist because Nagase informed the world as such, and it was named before the battle started as Ustonia assumed it would give their fighters a roughly equal match. After seeing the devastation brought about by the other craft, they fear the Deadlock more than anything. It is equipped with twin gauss cannons, a retractable railgun and laser beam cannon, high speed air-to-air missiles, omnidirectional multipurpose MIRV missiles, an automatic rear mounted CIWS, and is nuclear capable. Production was never planned. Dauntless (X-0) The Dauntless was meant to be a smaller, faster, more maneuverable craft than the Deadlock, but with equal firepower. However, it was stolen during development by a daring rookie test pilot, and was far from being finished. The airframe was complete, but it was still running a test engine at the time and was only equipped with basic guns and missiles. This plane being stolen is what directly led to the discovery of Destrean spies within Nagase and kicked off the whole incident. Rather than running three engines, it runs a single engine, designed to be able to toggle between turbojet and ramjet mode in flight, but the test engine lacked that ability. The plane and its daring pilot were taken by the Risky Witches before Shinzen or Destrea could get their hands on them. All that\u2019s known about the Dauntless are what it\u2019s designed to be theoretically capable of, but since its loss, its fate is unknown. Spacecraft programs: Outlander The Outlander program is the world\u2019s first successful deep space exploration program, with the ultimate goal of developing manned interstellar travel. Outlander 1, launched in 1983, was lost 11 months and 13 days into its mission, cause unknown as the craft seemed to have completely disappeared and was no longer visible from any telescopes. Outlander 2, launched in 1985, officially entered interstellar space exactly 30 years into its mission and is still in operation. Strider The Strider program is Nagase\u2019s contribution to the Global Space Platform project, being a dedicated personnel shuttle. It is a single stage to orbit craft with a capacity of 2 crew and 5 passengers, capable of both taking off and landing on an ordinary aircraft runway. Strider 1 was launched in 1998 at full capacity to fill the newly completed space station. It has since completed 34 more round trips and is still considered to be in service. Strider 2 was launched in 1999, but was tragically lost during landing due to an engine malfunction, killing all passengers. Strider 3 was launched in 2006, but aborted mission before exiting the atmosphere due to electrical malfunctions. The pilot shut down all non-critical electrical systems and safely landed the craft unassisted. It was studied extensively after that incident and now resides in an aerospace museum. Strider 4 was completed in 2008 but was immediately decommissioned after discovering a critical design flaw traced back to Strider 2. Strider 5 was launched in 2012 with no issues, has completed 21 round trips, and is still in service. Tomoe The Tomoe program was originally intended to replace the Strider program, but instead works hand-in-hand as its sister craft. Its name comes from Tomoe Harada, the late pilot of Strider 2. Smaller and sleeker, yet more powerful than the Strider craft, the Tomoe craft carries cargo rather than passengers, and is equipped with retractable articulating arms ranging for moving large objects or conducting repairs. Capable of reaching the space station in just over two thirds the time required for Strider to do so, Tomoe is also used for emergency transport. Tomoe 1 was launched in 2004 with no issues and completed 11 round trips before being decommissioned, and it now resides in an aerospace museum. Tomoe 2 was launched in 2005 with no issues and completed three round trips before being replaced by Tomoe 3. However, it was then modified to shed as much weight as possible and converted to an ambulance of sorts, has completed two emergency flights since then, and remains on standby. Tomoe 3 was completed in 2009 with no issues, has completed seven round trips, and is still in service.

It is headquartered in the city of Falkenvall in Kolg\u00e5rd , Osun Tanum . They are presumed to be the oldest known religious organization of all time, as there is no record of their formation, yet they have always possessed and been recorded in some of the oldest documents known to exist. Structure \u00b6 The Children of the Flame is divided into four unique branches, each performing a distinct function with their own positions and power structures. Only two of these branches - the Law and Lore and Preachers branches - are publicly acknowledged, with the other two - the Enforcers and Internal Society branches - shrouded in secrecy and only known due to undercover investigations and leaks. Law and Lore \u00b6 The Law and Lore branch of the Children of the Flame is responsible for the administration, bureaucracy, and other official dealings, as well as maintaining order within the organization through management and enforcement of laws, and keeping the lore, prophecies, and other history organized and prevalent in teachings. They are the highest ranking members of the organization with authority over all other branches. Those who commit sins serious enough that the Preachers cannot absolve them are instead brought to this branch, and if they are deemed repentant, they are given the choice to either undergo Cleansing or be expelled from the organization. Cleansing During Cleansing, the recipient is doused in water by a Cardinal, then a Firekeeper engulfs the recipient in flame while they prostrate themselves begging for forgiveness. This is repeated six times, and if all goes smoothly, the recipient is pardoned and lauded by everyone. The Storyteller \u00b6 This is the highest position in the organization. What this person says is absolute, and all decisions can be overruled by them. They have an encyclopedic knowledge of the history of the organization, their texts, and their laws. Traditionally, The Storyteller is meant to wear the most extravagant vestments and be treated like a god, and this was upheld until the Sixth reign where this and nearly every other tradition was either relaxed or thrown out. They are informed of every decision and action made by the organization at any point in time, but are rarely involved in the process unless it is a particularly major event, or when intervention is needed. There can be only one Storyteller at any given time, and the position - when available - is selected on merit alone. Cardinals \u00b6 These are the people responsible for all major decision making and organization of the faith. They oversee the Enforcers wing alone, and assist the Seekers in overseeing the Preachers wing. They wear extravagant black vestments with tall hats, but the High Cardinal is exempt from this, instead wearing what The Storyteller says to wear. They are akin to politicians in their role. To become a Cardinal, one must be selected personally by the High Cardinal and then perform the Cardinal\u2019s Rite. The High Cardinal is assigned directly to The Storyteller as an advisor and to relay information. Cardinal\u2019s Rite Prospective cardinals are selected to perform this rite personally by the High Cardinal. It is a purely ceremonial act, where the High Cardinal douses the prospective cardinal\u2019s head in black oil, and then burns the brand onto the back of their dominant hand. Seekers \u00b6 These are the people responsible for managing all activities of the Preachers wing, as well as overseeing the Internal Society. They are not concerned with managing the law, instead focusing on keeping the lore and history of the organization, while also acting as the lead scientists of the organization. They wear extravagant white vestments with no hat, but the High Seeker is exempt from this instead wearing what The Storyteller says to wear. The High Seeker acts as The Storyteller\u2019s right hand, and is almost always with him to discuss whatever needs discussing and help with whatever is needed. To become a Seeker, one must prove their merit through a series of tests and then perform the Seeker\u2019s Rite. Seeker\u2019s Rite Prospective seekers are selected to perform this rite. Those who succeed become a Seeker and those who fail are allowed to try again when they heal. The prospective seeker dons the ceremonial vestment and is brought to two Firekeepers who grab hold of the prospective seeker\u2019s forearms and begin to burn them. A Cardinal grabs hold of the prospective seeker\u2019s neck, raises them off the ground and begins to read sacred texts. If the prospective seeker remains conscious for the duration of the reading, they are asked if they are ready, and if they agree, the Firekeepers immolate the prospective seeker. If the prospective seeker\u2019s will is strong enough, the flames will not burn them and will be extinguished when the Cardinal releases them. Buckets of water and a medical team are kept on standby for the weak willed. Chancellors \u00b6 The bureaucrats of the organization, these are the people responsible for all administrative tasks and paper pushing. Almost all paperwork that needs to be done by any other member of the organization is usually routed to the Chancellors, and the Chancellors are often the ones delivering official orders. They wear understated vestments that distinguish them from all other classes. Becoming a Chancellor is as simple as filling out a form and turning in a resume. Firekeepers \u00b6 The mystics of the organization, these elite few are Attunement users with an affinity for flames. These are the people responsible for the performance of most holy tasks, meting out internal punishments, and mystifying the people in public demonstrations. They wear light and wavy vestments with open or no footwear, designed to exude an aura of exotic elegance. Firekeepers are chosen from the Initiates after displaying promise both in faith and ability, and are then asked to perform the Mystic Dance, only allowed to become a Firekeeper if their dance impresses both the High Cardinal and High Seeker. Out of all positions within the organization, the Firekeepers are often seen as the closest to divinity, even among secular people. Mystic Dance Firekeepers perform a mesmerizing ceremonial dance similar to a ribbon dance, but with flames instead of ribbons. They use no tools, implements, or anything else for the dance, only their own attunement abilities to create mesmerizing displays of elegance and controlled chaos. The Mystic Dance can be choreographed before being performed, particularly for public demonstrations or large group performances, but when performed by an individual, it is always unique to that person. These dances often have profound effects on the audience, but the effect varies from person to person, and exactly how this happens is unclear, as the Firekeepers themselves do not have an answer for why it happens, only saying that it is not their intention. Preachers \u00b6 The Preachers branch of the Children of the Flame is not quite what one would expect by the name. Their primary responsibility lies not in spreading the word of their faith, but rather in public relations, leaving the actual preaching to the lowest ranked members. These people are the face of the group, the only part that the vast majority of people know. The Preachers also give blessings to certain individuals, either by deeming them deserving of blessing or in need of one. Blessing of the Flame This is a ceremonial rite performed by a Reverend or Patriarch. The recipient is asked to kneel in front of them and bow their head, then the Reverend or Patriarch delivers a powerful speech designed to manipulate the minds of those who hear it into feeling empowered, invigorated, or absolved. Charisma is vital to successfully perform this rite, as the strength of the blessing is only as strong as the conviction of the Reverend or Patriarch delivering it. The effects vary depending on what the recipient thinks, what is being said, and how charismatic the performer is. Patriarchs \u00b6 The \u201cfatherly\u201d types of the organization, these are the people that the entire Preachers wing answer to. They wear extravagant vestments and are rarely seen in public except for ceremonial occasions, but those within the organization beneath them tend to look up to the Patriarchs as role models. Mostly unknown to everyone, however, the Patriarchs also play a part in the Internal Society of the organization, evaluating Initiates to see whether or not they would fit as Eunuchs and sometimes engaging in debauchery with the Internal Society behind closed doors. Patriarchs are appointed personally by the Seekers. Reverends \u00b6 These are the people that the public imagine when they hear about the organization. They all have subtle but distinct vestments allowing them to stand out from the public, and they are all trained to appear as warm, friendly and approachable as possible, making them exude a divine and pleasant aura. They dedicate much of their time to helping those in need, and are commonly seen assisting with disaster relief, humanitarian fundraising events, and grand openings of public buildings. They are also responsible for hearing the confessions of those who feel they have sinned and absolve them, and to baptize new listeners so they may be considered officially Devout. Becoming a Reverend is as simple as expressing interest to a Patriarch, who will then look over the things they have done to help the public and decide whether or not the prospective Reverend is worthy. In special cases, they may be selected by a Firekeeper instead. Priests \u00b6 These are the people on the front lines of the public, making every effort to help people in need and sharing their knowledge of the organization to those showing interest. They blend in seamlessly with the public due to wearing no vestments and not being outspoken about the organization. Becoming a Priest is as simple as expressing interest to a Reverend. Initiates \u00b6 These are the men who among the Devout display a vested interest in the faith, and are noticed by the Firekeepers as promising. They are taken under the wing of a Firekeeper and given basic training in what it takes to become one, which they can then choose to continue if they wish to become Firekeepers, or opt to become Reverends instead. Few Initiates are instead taken by the Internal Society through temptation. Enforcers \u00b6 Warning Very few people are aware of the existence of this branch, and virtually all of them are higher ranking members of the Children of the Flame. It is also an extremely small portion of the organization, counting less than 10,000 people in its membership. The Enforcers branch of the Children of the Flame is a quite small but very powerful force of militaristic people, responsible for all the dirty work of the organization. They operate from the shadows for the most part, killing their targets quietly, simply gathering intelligence, or manipulating people for their own ends, though occasionally they will make large, organized, very public attacks when ordered. Under the reign of The Fifth Storyteller, the Enforcers were almost removed entirely, but they have slowly built themselves back up under The Sixth Storyteller, though it is unclear how or why. When sent to deal with a specific target, they typically use one of three methods of punishment, being Banishment, Forgiveness, or Purification. Banishment, Forgiveness, and Purification (graphic violence description) Banishment is performed by an Inquisitor. The recipient is tortured until their mind is broken, and then the Inquisitor violently grabs hold of their face and delivers a scathing reprimand, finalized by throwing the recipient into the nearest hard surface or by submerging their head in water. Those who survive this horrific procedure are usually left in a vegetative state for the remainder of their lives, and those few who manage to recover or resist are marked for death. Forgiveness is performed by one of the Sanctified, as a much more merciful version of the rite of Banishment. The recipient is restrained, their crimes explained, a sacred text read to them, and finalized with a swift decapitation. Notably, they will always give the recipient a proper burial and even inform and console the next of kin if they\u2019re alive and not themselves guilty. Purification is performed by either an Inquisitor or one of the Sanctified, and is reserved for the truly heinous heretics. The recipient is restrained and stretched on a rack, sacred texts are fervently read, then the recipient is cut open with a Y-shaped incision and immolated from the inside out. Inquisitors \u00b6 These are the people responsible for identifying and dealing with heretics and any others marked by the higher-ups of the organization. They are most known for their use of gruesome torture methods and seeming to take pleasure in carrying them out, but are most commonly sent out purely for espionage. Notably, no Inquisitors possess attunement. Becoming an Inquisitor requires a test to prove oneself dedicated. This test is decided on a case by case basis and must be carried out alone. The Sanctified \u00b6 These people are, in essence, a merciful version of the Inquisitors, and much more focused on the divine aspect of their work. Where the Inquisitors derive pleasure or entertainment in their tasks, The Sanctified are disgusted by the barbaric nature. They take great pride as divine and merciful executioners. Notably, all of The Sanctified possess attunement. There are an extremely small number of The Sanctified due both to the rarity of attunement and the difficulty of the training required. The Infernal \u00b6 The Infernal are the front line infantry of the Enforcers, almost never being trusted with important tasks and most often being utilized in great numbers. They are selected by Inquisitors or the Sanctified based on ability and desire, and are eligible to become one of the higher ranks based on merit and seniority. Internal Society \u00b6 Warning Extremely few people are aware of the existence of this branch, and virtually all of them are higher ranking members of the Children of the Flame. It is also an extremely small portion of the organization, counting less than 10,000 people in its membership. The Internal Society of the Children of the Flame shares very little with the other branches, or even the general concept of the faith, instead operating much like a dynastic harem and a predatory prostitution ring. They proudly defy the ethical and moral codes of the organization, and were even considered to contradict the established morals of the organization when they were first established under The Third Storyteller. The continued presence of this part of the organization is a point of extreme contention among those who are aware of it, as nobody outside of the Internal Society believes it should be allowed to exist, nor do they understand how it persists. The true amount of influence the Internal Society holds over the organization is still unknown. The efforts of the Fifth and the continuing efforts of the Sixth storytellers have not been enough to remove the Internal Society, but their numbers have been reduced to a small fraction of what they once were, and they have supposedly been effectively quarantined within the organization, and are kept secret. Matriarchs \u00b6 These elite women are, in essence, super Sirens. Everything a Siren can do, a Matriarch can do better. However, they remain sequestered in the Internal Society to manage things, instead targeting Patriarchs and Initiates with their various controlling techniques. They evaluate prospective Initiates alongside the corrupted Patriarchs. Occasionally, they will take a Patriarch as a husband, though they ultimately hold higher authority than the Patriarchs do. All Matriarchs possess attunement. Sirens \u00b6 These women are masters of seduction, manipulation and trickery. Of the entire Internal Society, they are the only ones ever seen in public, though they aren\u2019t recognized because they have no vestments. They hypnotize - figuratively or literally depending on the person and their abilities - unsuspecting or vulnerable people and manipulate them into doing their bidding or give them what they want, most commonly using their bodies to their advantage. Despite the inherent sinfulness in being a Siren, much of the money they steal is donated to the organization. Most Sirens possess attunement. Sirens with attunement sometimes use it against their victims in one of two ways, referred to as Draining and Breaking. Draining and Breaking (sexual content) Draining utilizes their already exceptional abilities of hypnosis and manipulation and amplifies the effects through attunement. Recipients are slowly hypnotized during a sexual encounter and not allowed to orgasm until they are under full control of the performer, where they then use the moment of orgasm to implant an idea or an order in the recipient\u2019s mind with frightening efficacy. The recipient is left extremely exhausted after this but unable to sleep, and they feel hollow and lost for up to a week after the encounter, assuming the performer doesn\u2019t repeat the rite immediately. It can be repeated as many times as the performer wants, even to the point of killing the recipient. Breaking is very similar to the rite of Draining, but instead designed purely to humiliate, demoralize, and ultimately break the mind. Some recipients may end up in a vegetative state, others may have a permanent personality change, the effect varies. It can also be repeated to the point of death. Eunuchs \u00b6 These are the men who, as Initiates, showed a strong will and resisted all temptation from the Sirens, while also showing enough respect to have made no advances on the Sisters. They are then brought before the Matriarchs to be castrated, and from then on dedicate themselves to guarding the Internal Society. They generally develop pseudo-familial relationships with the women which only strengthens their devotion. Sisters \u00b6 These are the women who, as Initiates, were somehow deemed interesting enough by the Matriarchs to be taken for the Internal Society. They are taken under the wing of the Sirens and treated as little sisters, hence the name, and indoctrinated into the Internal Society. Those who display enough willpower to resist indoctrination are brought before the Matriarchs and tested, where they will either pass and become Sirens or fail and be psychologically abused until they become totally dependent on the Matriarchs. History \u00b6 While the specific origins of the Children of the Flame are unknown, it is likely that they have existed since the end of Era Dira. Allegedly, they formed after seeing their gods help to rebuild in the aftermath of the The End of Everything , and their worship slowly strengthened after their gods disappeared and more emphasis was instead placed on the ancient texts they had collected. Their faith was global, but disorganized until the reformation of the faith under a leader known as a Storyteller, which occurred around the year 1160. There have been six Storytellers since then, and each Storyteller steered the organization in radically different directions. The First Storyteller rallied the organization around the goals of peace and prosperity among humankind, which despite apparent good intentions, led to a spike and subsequent long term upward trend of racism against spirits . This reign lasted about 100 years. The Second Storyteller was a product of the racism inadvertently encouraged by the First, and pivoted the focus of the organization to the domination and subjugation of spirits, leading to the formation of the Enforcers. Numerous atrocities were carried out under the reign of the Second. This reign lasted about 60 years. The Third Storyteller was a product of the complacency brought about by the actions of the Second. Tired of the militant attitude, they loosened the iron grip of the organization and encouraged hedonism among listeners, leading to the formation of the Internal Society. This reign lasted about 90 years. The Fourth Storyteller idolized stories of the Second and turned the organization back towards violence, this time not only craving dominance, but absolute supremacy. The Enforcers branch of the organization grew in size and scope as the entire organization was mobilized on numerous crusades around the world for the entire reign, the atrocities committed against both spirits and humans in the process including some of the very worst in history. This reign lasted about 40 years. The Fifth Storyteller, disgusted by the Fourth, began their reign by taking the head of the Fourth and executing all those who took part in the atrocities of the crusades. The organization largely withdrew from the public and much of what happened during this reign remains unknown, shrouded in secrecy, but it is known that a concerted effort was made to address and take responsibility for much of the Fourth\u2019s wrongdoings, while also laying the groundwork for some progressive change within the organization. This reign lasted about 110 years. The Sixth Storyteller brought the organization back into the public as a drastically reformed beacon of light. For the first time, the focus of the organization shifted away from strict religious adherence, instead adopting an interpersonal approach to spirituality, while also dedicating most of the organization\u2019s funding and manpower to global public benefit through charity, research, and disaster relief. The Enforcers and Internal Society branches of the organization were also removed entirely from the public, but remain active within the organization. This reign is ongoing. Public Agenda \u00b6 Under the reign of The Sixth Storyteller , the primary public goals of the organization have been humanitarian and charitable efforts, cultural development, and scientific research. They are lauded worldwide for their efforts in these fields, particularly for being among the largest contributing forces across many disaster relief efforts around the world, the largest financial contributors for numerous charities, credited as a major influence or contributor in many culturally significant works, and most notably, for being instrumental in the discovery of Mystic Matter . The organization acts as its own public relations manager and spends a lot of time maintaining a positive appearance by widely publicizing the products of their contributions to the public, even when another religious organization is involved, while also working around the clock to counter or bury controversies and allegations raised against them. This effort is the primary driving force in the still rapidly increasing numbers of devout listeners. The stated goals of the organization are to provide the resources and tools necessary to achieve a higher overall quality of life for listeners and those around them, and the promise that faithful listeners will be spared in the coming end times. Political influence \u00b6 Testament to the immense influence and drive of The Sixth Storyteller, the Children of the Flame hold great power in the politics of the world, often finding themselves involved - directly or indirectly, intentionally or not - with elections around the world, as well as policy and law decisions. Due to their humanitarian and charitable efforts along with their dedication to cultural development and scientific research, the organization also has strong ties with many major corporations around the world. The most notable exceptions to this are 11K and the Risky Witches , as these three groups are outwardly wary of each other and regularly find themselves at odds on issues, but chances are that no matter where you are in the world, one of these three groups was probably involved in any major political or corporate action you can think of. Assets \u00b6 The Children of the Flame are in possession of nearly 40% of all known intact artifacts of Era Dira , most of which are texts, ranging from scrolls to loose papers to leather bound books. Many of these ancient texts are considered divine by the organization, but are today treated primarily as pieces of history rather than sources of guidance in modern life. The vast majority of these artifacts are proudly displayed in the grand library located at the Falkenvall headquarters, but there is at least one artifact kept in every major gathering place around the world. They have all been digitized by the organization, and digital copies are made available to the public free of charge. About 80% of these texts have been translated into multiple modern languages, but the remaining untranslated texts are written in an ancient language that is still in the early stages of study. Funding \u00b6 Most of their funding is provided by donations, primarily from members. There is no tithing or other collection. Smaller sources of funding for the organization come from real estate, royalties for non-religious media attributed to the organization, printing fees from renting out their many printing facilities to other organizations and corporations, and the sale of lifestyle products produced by companies owned by the organization. The Internal Society is also a source of funding for the organization, though this is a deeply controversial situation both outside and within the organization. The Children of the Flame have been listed as one of the 50 richest corporations in the Ozen Federation , and one of the 20 richest in Osun Tanum. Real estate \u00b6 The Children of the Flame own and maintain all of their own gathering halls, which are simply called \u201challs\u201d within the organization, in great numbers all over the world. These buildings are funded entirely by the organization, and do not generate any form of income. They also own and maintain a vast network of printing facilities around the world that were once used to print copies of their holy texts, but have now been converted into print-on-demand businesses for others to utilize, generating a significant income for the organization. The organization owns a large portion of the land within the city of Falkenvall. Historically it was used exclusively for the purposes of the organization, but The Sixth Storyteller has had most of their buildings replaced with residential tenements that are mostly rented out to the public, with some units being offered free of charge to the poor and homeless under the agreement that they will either begin to pay rent or move elsewhere once they find employment that pays a living wage, and that they will actively search for such employment. Units that are not rented to the public are instead kept available for travelling preachers. The organization owns similar residential complexes in many other places around the world, many operating in the same manner. Being a religious organization, the Children of the Flame are not required to pay property taxes on their land in most of the world. Beliefs \u00b6 The Children of the Flame worship the immortal Incarnations and venerate them as deities. These are Florian (The Destroyer), Freya (The Deceiver), and Kerosyn (The Deliverer). They also view the mortal incarnations as divine, but not as deities and do not worship them. They originally based much of their beliefs on the numerous ancient texts they hold in their library, but have largely moved away from that belief system under the reign of The Sixth Storyteller. Instead, belief is focused more strongly on adherence to a set of morals and ethics laid out in texts written by the Storytellers, under the assumption that remaining faithful while behaving in accordance with the expectations of the faith will grant listeners life in the next era, and that such listeners who have died will be resurrected at that time. The organization does not encourage belief in any form of afterlife. They believe that death is a state of non-existence with no consciousness, and that there is no Heaven or Hell. Their belief in a grand resurrection at the start of the next era is reliant on the actions of their deities, which have been proven to exist both by the organization and many outside of it, and is supported by Freya\u2019s ability to resurrect after death, no matter what state her body is left in. Historically, the organization considered their texts to be inerrant, scientifically and historically accurate and reliable, and interpreted the vast majority of it literally. Listeners were encouraged to frequently read the texts personally, but discouraged from formulating doctrines and \u201cprivate ideas\u201d reached through independent research, and were cautioned against reading other religious literature. Adherents were told to have complete confidence in the leadership, to avoid skepticism about what is taught through the texts and other literature from the organization, and to \u201cnot advocate or insist on personal opinions or harbor private ideas when it comes to diving understanding.\u201d The organization made no provision for listeners to criticize or contribute to official teachings. Today, many of those beliefs have been relaxed by The Sixth Storyteller. It is now an accepted belief that some of their texts are factually incorrect, and many are not meant to be interpreted literally. Listeners are still encouraged to frequently read these texts personally, and are no longer discouraged from conducting independent research or presenting criticism or new ideas to the organization if it is done privately and in good faith. Tenets \u00b6 Every follower is expected to adhere to these six virtues at all times unless given no choice, or when possessing an infallible reason to go against them. These virtues all originate from existing ancient texts, but have evolved over time to suit the changing world, particularly under The Sixth Storyteller. One is expected to practice Wisdom. Remain curious, creative, and open minded, so that you may shine brightly and flourish. One is expected to practice Courage. Hold fast in times of hardship, and do not falter when your integrity is challenged. One is expected to practice Justice. If none stand up first, take charge and lead them fairly, so they may repent for their sins. One is expected to practice Humanity. A fair life does not end with fairness, but with love, kindness, and awareness. One is expected to practice Temperance. Seek calmness, remain humble, and show mercy to those who have wronged you. One is expected to strive for Transcendence. Always remain hopeful, express deserved gratitude, and become a beacon of light. Ethics and morality \u00b6 Before the reign of The Sixth Storyteller, the organization held an extremely conservative moral code, and enforced them strictly. All sexual relations outside of marriage were grounds for expulsion if the individual was not deemed repentant. Homosexual activity was considered an unforgivable sin, and same-sex marriages were forbidden. Abortion was considered murder, and suicide was considered self-murder, both treated as unforgivable sins. Divorce was discouraged, and remarriage was forbidden in all cases except when divorce was obtained on the grounds of adultery. Remarriage itself was considered adulterous in those cases. Marrying someone outside of the organization or endorsing such a union was strongly discouraged. The husband of a family was considered to have absolute authority in all family decisions. Listeners were even discouraged from maintaining friendships with people outside of the organization, and were instead expected to treat such others as \u201cassociates\u201d. It was also the case that women were barred from holding positions of authority within the organization and were not allowed to address the organization directly, except in rare circumstances when there was no eligible man to do so. Under The Sixth Storyteller, all of those aspects of the moral code within the organization have been relaxed or undone. While it is still recommended that listeners focus their relationships towards other listeners, it is no longer a requirement. The husband is no longer considered the absolute authority of the family, and women are now considered equal to men within the organization. Sex outside of marriage, divorce and remarriage, homosexuality, same-sex marriage, and abortion are no longer considered sins at all. Suicide is also no longer considered a sin, and the organization now approaches suicidal listeners and their loved ones with compassion rather than a stern rebuke. Transgender identities were never specifically addressed by the organization prior to The Sixth Storyteller, who made it clear that transgender individuals are valid and to be treated as the gender they present themselves as without prejudice. Today, in a complete inversion from the traditional beliefs of the organization prior to the reign of The Sixth Storyteller, it is considered a sin to view one\u2019s self as above, or worth more than another, particularly when comparing to people outside of the organization. Bearing witness to an injustice that one could feasibly stand against, and choosing not to do so, is also considered a sin, and depending on the weight of the injustice, may even be an unforgivable sin. Homophobia, transphobia, and racism are also considered sins. Worship \u00b6 Generally, displays of worship are not expected among members of the organization except during special occasions, such as the performance of a rite. All members of the organization are treated as faithful worshipers so long as they remain without sin, or repent promptly. Because of this lax nature, even secular individuals can often be found living in line with the expectations of the organization. Even in the presence of the deities themselves, people are not expected to stifle themselves. A common prayer among the organization is a glorification of the three deities. Some scholars believe it was once a specialized prayer among dozens of others, but today it is used only for traditional purposes and is the only prayer still persistent in the organization. Quod liberator, deceptor, et eversor, gloria nomini tuo. Sicut in principio, nunc et in perpetuum. Amen. Sources of belief \u00b6 Many core beliefs of the Children of the Flame are based on the many ancient texts found in their library, but unlike other religions throughout history, these texts were never collected into a single source. Instead, the texts are regarded separately as \u201cstories\u201d which are taught and studied independently of all other stories, unless there are direct references connecting them. These stories are regarded as divine, though many of them do not have an attributed author, and notably, none of them were written by the three deities of the organization. In recent years, based on guidance from those three deities, it is believed by the organization that many of the stories were written by the deities that came before. Several of these stories are corroborated by independent historians around the world and throughout the decades and centuries, but many have been malformed, mistranslated, and misinterpreted throughout history, with others still having passages and pages lost entirely. The organization keeps all of the incorrect versions of their stories available to the public, but recommends against reading them unless doing so as part of historical research. Four stories are particularly notable both within and outside of the organization, with religious and secular people alike. The Beginning \u00b6 This story, known more generally as the common myth , describes the process of the world\u2019s creation. It has spawned countless variations and interpretations throughout history, but every single variation shares at least one commonality: They all depict \u201cThe Creator\u201d as a beautiful woman who sacrificed herself for humanity. Some interpretations claim she did it to save humans from destruction, others believe it was an attempt to eradicate them, and countless interpretations exist between those two extremes. The Reckoning \u00b6 This is the story recounting the great wars of humanity before the end of everything. All interpretations contain the statement that human population dropped to near extinction, but each version of the story has its own idea of the cause. Some say it\u2019s because humans invoked the wrath of the gods, others say it was hubris or arrogance, a petty conflict that got out of hand, among many other causes. Many stories have mentioned a god by name, but these names were never corroborated by other variations. The one exception to that observation is Morrigan, who appears as a goddess of death and misery in many variations of the story, contributing to the feared reputation of the crows . The Inferno \u00b6 This story is the most consistent across multiple versions. It describes an event known by most as The End of Everything, and as Armageddon to some others. A common theme found in all versions of this story is that the world was bathed in fire with only a minuscule fraction of life remaining to rebuild. This is the event dividing Era Dira and Anno Ortu on the calendar. The most notorious variation of this story was a complete fabrication, introduced by a power-hungry High Cardinal as part of a plan to slowly gain direct control over the listeners before The Sixth Storyteller had a chance to publicize his account, and was preserved to be used as an example in educational materials used to teach listeners how to identify false information. The false story And in the end times, the false one bore control of the world and was to marshal it to ruination, yet the destroyer stood up to the false one and engaged him in war. They fought for a thousand years bringing perpetual wink and woe to all those around them, till one day appeared the deceiver, whom tricked them into believing neither one was content to battle any longer, and mocked the men into worshiping her as the one righteous god for a thousand years. And in the two thousandth year, the deliverer stood up and denounced those men for their sins, and he demonstrated his righteousness by taking the heart of the false one and burning him towards the pyre, from which the flames spread across all of the of the world, and the destroyer known his righteous bid and was sent to amerce those men of sin, while those men whom saw the righteousness of the deliverer and pledged themselves to him were spared, among them, the deceiver prostrated herself and declared herself to be reformed. And towards the day of the solar eclipse, the deliverer granted a righteous speech to those men whom pledged to him, and bestowed upon them the code to live by, lest the destroyer amerce their sins, and then he rose up and the entirety of the world was bathed in his holy flame, born anew from the ashes, our home. The Sixth Storyteller\u2019s Account \u00b6 A story in itself, this account was written by The Sixth Storyteller after a private meeting with the three deities of the organization. In this account, details of all three previous stories are covered and rectified, along with new information not previously known, though it is more of a life story of the deities than an informative report. It was kept secret for a number of years following the spread of the fabricated story of The Inferno and was even tampered with, presumably by the power-hungry High Cardinal. The original tampered documents are preserved in the library for posterity, and the digitally restored version is widely available. Criticism \u00b6 The Children of the Flame have received criticism from other religious organizations, former members, governments, academics, and more throughout the history of the organization. They have been accused of doctrinal inconsistency and reversals, failed predictions, mistranslations of historical artifacts for their own benefit, harsh treatment of former members, connection to numerous high profile murders and sexual abuse cases, and autocratic and coercive leadership. Under the reign of The Sixth Storyteller, much of this criticism has been addressed and many accept certain problems as resolved, though some people still do not believe the organization has taken adequate action, and some points of contention are still unresolved. Unfulfilled predictions \u00b6 A core belief of the organization is that an apocalyptic event is going to happen in the future, and only the faithful ones will be spared at that time. Ever since the organization has had a Storyteller, innumerable predictions have been made for when this time will come, all of which have proven themselves false. Many listeners throughout history have had their lives uprooted by these failed predictions after choosing to sell their homes and belongings in preparation for the end that never came. They believe that \u201cwe are living in the last days\u201d but have not been consistent in identifying when that began. The \u201clast days\u201d have \u201cbegun\u201d in 1649, 1799, 1804, 1844, 1904, and 1915. Since the beginning of The Sixth Storyteller\u2019s reign, while inconsistencies regarding the \u201clast days\u201d have continued to be presented, there have notably been no more predictions regarding the End of Everything. A standing prediction from the previous reign that the End of Everything would occur in 1975 was even retracted and denounced by The Sixth Storyteller shortly after the beginning of his reign.

They use no tools, implements, or anything else for the dance, only their own attunement abilities to create mesmerizing displays of elegance and controlled chaos. The Mystic Dance can be choreographed before being performed, particularly for public demonstrations or large group performances, but when performed by an individual, it is always unique to that person. These dances often have profound effects on the audience, but the effect varies from person to person, and exactly how this happens is unclear, as the Firekeepers themselves do not have an answer for why it happens, only saying that it is not their intention.","title":"Firekeepers"},{"location":"Nova-Regna/World/Organizations/Religions%20%26%20Cults/Children%20of%20the%20Flame/#preachers","text":"The Preachers branch of the Children of the Flame is not quite what one would expect by the name.

Blessing of the Flame This is a ceremonial rite performed by a Reverend or Patriarch. The recipient is asked to kneel in front of them and bow their head, then the Reverend or Patriarch delivers a powerful speech designed to manipulate the minds of those who hear it into feeling empowered, invigorated, or absolved.

Under the reign of The Fifth Storyteller, the Enforcers were almost removed entirely, but they have slowly built themselves back up under The Sixth Storyteller, though it is unclear how or why. When sent to deal with a specific target, they typically use one of three methods of punishment, being Banishment, Forgiveness, or Purification. Banishment, Forgiveness, and Purification (graphic violence description) Banishment is performed by an Inquisitor. The recipient is tortured until their mind is broken, and then the Inquisitor violently grabs hold of their face and delivers a scathing reprimand, finalized by throwing the recipient into the nearest hard surface or by submerging their head in water. Those who survive this horrific procedure are usually left in a vegetative state for the remainder of their lives, and those few who manage to recover or resist are marked for death. Forgiveness is performed by one of the Sanctified, as a much more merciful version of the rite of Banishment. The recipient is restrained, their crimes explained, a sacred text read to them, and finalized with a swift decapitation. Notably, they will always give the recipient a proper burial and even inform and console the next of kin if they\u2019re alive and not themselves guilty. Purification is performed by either an Inquisitor or one of the Sanctified, and is reserved for the truly heinous heretics.

Sirens with attunement sometimes use it against their victims in one of two ways, referred to as Draining and Breaking. Draining and Breaking (sexual content) Draining utilizes their already exceptional abilities of hypnosis and manipulation and amplifies the effects through attunement. Recipients are slowly hypnotized during a sexual encounter and not allowed to orgasm until they are under full control of the performer, where they then use the moment of orgasm to implant an idea or an order in the recipient\u2019s mind with frightening efficacy. The recipient is left extremely exhausted after this but unable to sleep, and they feel hollow and lost for up to a week after the encounter, assuming the performer doesn\u2019t repeat the rite immediately.

Allegedly, they formed after seeing their gods help to rebuild in the aftermath of the The End of Everything , and their worship slowly strengthened after their gods disappeared and more emphasis was instead placed on the ancient texts they had collected. Their faith was global, but disorganized until the reformation of the faith under a leader known as a Storyteller, which occurred around the year 1160. There have been six Storytellers since then, and each Storyteller steered the organization in radically different directions. The First Storyteller rallied the organization around the goals of peace and prosperity among humankind, which despite apparent good intentions, led to a spike and subsequent long term upward trend of racism against spirits . This reign lasted about 100 years. The Second Storyteller was a product of the racism inadvertently encouraged by the First, and pivoted the focus of the organization to the domination and subjugation of spirits, leading to the formation of the Enforcers. Numerous atrocities were carried out under the reign of the Second. This reign lasted about 60 years. The Third Storyteller was a product of the complacency brought about by the actions of the Second. Tired of the militant attitude, they loosened the iron grip of the organization and encouraged hedonism among listeners, leading to the formation of the Internal Society. This reign lasted about 90 years. The Fourth Storyteller idolized stories of the Second and turned the organization back towards violence, this time not only craving dominance, but absolute supremacy. The Enforcers branch of the organization grew in size and scope as the entire organization was mobilized on numerous crusades around the world for the entire reign, the atrocities committed against both spirits and humans in the process including some of the very worst in history. This reign lasted about 40 years. The Fifth Storyteller, disgusted by the Fourth, began their reign by taking the head of the Fourth and executing all those who took part in the atrocities of the crusades. The organization largely withdrew from the public and much of what happened during this reign remains unknown, shrouded in secrecy, but it is known that a concerted effort was made to address and take responsibility for much of the Fourth\u2019s wrongdoings, while also laying the groundwork for some progressive change within the organization. This reign lasted about 110 years. The Sixth Storyteller brought the organization back into the public as a drastically reformed beacon of light. For the first time, the focus of the organization shifted away from strict religious adherence, instead adopting an interpersonal approach to spirituality, while also dedicating most of the organization\u2019s funding and manpower to global public benefit through charity, research, and disaster relief. The Enforcers and Internal Society branches of the organization were also removed entirely from the public, but remain active within the organization.

The organization acts as its own public relations manager and spends a lot of time maintaining a positive appearance by widely publicizing the products of their contributions to the public, even when another religious organization is involved, while also working around the clock to counter or bury controversies and allegations raised against them.

They originally based much of their beliefs on the numerous ancient texts they hold in their library, but have largely moved away from that belief system under the reign of The Sixth Storyteller. Instead, belief is focused more strongly on adherence to a set of morals and ethics laid out in texts written by the Storytellers, under the assumption that remaining faithful while behaving in accordance with the expectations of the faith will grant listeners life in the next era, and that such listeners who have died will be resurrected at that time. The organization does not encourage belief in any form of afterlife. They believe that death is a state of non-existence with no consciousness, and that there is no Heaven or Hell. Their belief in a grand resurrection at the start of the next era is reliant on the actions of their deities, which have been proven to exist both by the organization and many outside of it, and is supported by Freya\u2019s ability to resurrect after death, no matter what state her body is left in. Historically, the organization considered their texts to be inerrant, scientifically and historically accurate and reliable, and interpreted the vast majority of it literally. Listeners were encouraged to frequently read the texts personally, but discouraged from formulating doctrines and \u201cprivate ideas\u201d reached through independent research, and were cautioned against reading other religious literature.

All sexual relations outside of marriage were grounds for expulsion if the individual was not deemed repentant. Homosexual activity was considered an unforgivable sin, and same-sex marriages were forbidden. Abortion was considered murder, and suicide was considered self-murder, both treated as unforgivable sins. Divorce was discouraged, and remarriage was forbidden in all cases except when divorce was obtained on the grounds of adultery. Remarriage itself was considered adulterous in those cases. Marrying someone outside of the organization or endorsing such a union was strongly discouraged. The husband of a family was considered to have absolute authority in all family decisions. Listeners were even discouraged from maintaining friendships with people outside of the organization, and were instead expected to treat such others as \u201cassociates\u201d. It was also the case that women were barred from holding positions of authority within the organization and were not allowed to address the organization directly, except in rare circumstances when there was no eligible man to do so. Under The Sixth Storyteller, all of those aspects of the moral code within the organization have been relaxed or undone. While it is still recommended that listeners focus their relationships towards other listeners, it is no longer a requirement. The husband is no longer considered the absolute authority of the family, and women are now considered equal to men within the organization. Sex outside of marriage, divorce and remarriage, homosexuality, same-sex marriage, and abortion are no longer considered sins at all. Suicide is also no longer considered a sin, and the organization now approaches suicidal listeners and their loved ones with compassion rather than a stern rebuke. Transgender identities were never specifically addressed by the organization prior to The Sixth Storyteller, who made it clear that transgender individuals are valid and to be treated as the gender they present themselves as without prejudice. Today, in a complete inversion from the traditional beliefs of the organization prior to the reign of The Sixth Storyteller, it is considered a sin to view one\u2019s self as above, or worth more than another, particularly when comparing to people outside of the organization. Bearing witness to an injustice that one could feasibly stand against, and choosing not to do so, is also considered a sin, and depending on the weight of the injustice, may even be an unforgivable sin.

The false story And in the end times, the false one bore control of the world and was to marshal it to ruination, yet the destroyer stood up to the false one and engaged him in war. They fought for a thousand years bringing perpetual wink and woe to all those around them, till one day appeared the deceiver, whom tricked them into believing neither one was content to battle any longer, and mocked the men into worshiping her as the one righteous god for a thousand years. And in the two thousandth year, the deliverer stood up and denounced those men for their sins, and he demonstrated his righteousness by taking the heart of the false one and burning him towards the pyre, from which the flames spread across all of the of the world, and the destroyer known his righteous bid and was sent to amerce those men of sin, while those men whom saw the righteousness of the deliverer and pledged themselves to him were spared, among them, the deceiver prostrated herself and declared herself to be reformed. And towards the day of the solar eclipse, the deliverer granted a righteous speech to those men whom pledged to him, and bestowed upon them the code to live by, lest the destroyer amerce their sins, and then he rose up and the entirety of the world was bathed in his holy flame, born anew from the ashes, our home.","title":"The Inferno"},{"location":"Nova-Regna/World/Organizations/Religions%20%26%20Cults/Children%20of%20the%20Flame/#the-sixth-storytellers-account","text":"A story in itself, this account was written by The Sixth Storyteller after a private meeting with the three deities of the organization.

Knowing about this may change the way you think about the rest of the world. By the very nature of this place, virtually nobody in the world knows it exists, or even about Minerva. Think very carefully before writing anything involving this place if the characters mentioned here are anything other than central to the story. The Absolute Library is a colossal underground structure filled with books as far as the eye can see, chronologically documenting all of history, the lives of every individual who ever lived, all knowledge that is yet known to the world, and many thousands of years of prophecy written in highly specific detail, all of which has proven true so far. It is the home of Minerva , and her life\u2019s work, as she is constantly writing new books to keep the collection up to date, though she does also rely heavily on the help of her many mouse servants that also live in the Library. The Library is physically located inside the tallest mountain of Himlav\u00e5rd , but its structure is impossible. It is far larger than the mountain it is contained within, the main hall extending so far that is has its own horizon, which appears perfectly flat to the eye. Some doors lead to rooms in completely disconnected locations. Some doors all lead to the same room, no matter where they are. The main hall also loops back on itself along its length, allowing a person to walk infinitely in the same direction despite being in an enclosed space, yet it also grows longer to accommodate more bookshelves as they become necessary. It would be impossible to traverse the entire Library normally due to its sheer size, but the many impossible doors allow Minerva and the mouse spirits to travel wherever they need to go quite quickly. None of the doors in the Library are labelled or numbered, however, so an outsider would have no hope of navigating them without a guide. The Library has never been discovered independently by outsiders due to Minerva\u2019s influence, utilizing her godly Attunement not only to maintain the impossible structure, but to completely and absolutely conceal its existence from any form of detection, and to subtly repel any people who get too close and do not have her approval. Essentially, it does not exist at all except to those who Minerva allows to know. The immense amount of energy it takes for her to do all of that leaves her unable to attract and recruit suitable new mouse spirits, however, so she delegates that task to Haida so that the Library may forever continue to operate, new books constantly being written, never falling behind the present time by more than an hour. Vanishingly few people ever receive Minerva\u2019s approval, and not all of them get to see the Library in their lifetimes. Notable outsiders who know (or knew) of the Library - aside from Haida and the mouse spirits - include Ain , Freya , Kerosyn , Florian , Neven , The Sixth Storyteller , Seth Alden , Saint Serafina , Mae Seraphine Walker , and Kaede Hijiya .

The Hijiya Corporation EVA (Envirovoltaic Armature) Driver is an extremely compact circular device capable of generating incredible amounts of electricity indefinitely, with no fuel consumption or routine maintenance required. These devices come in several different sizes and profiles to suit a variety of needs, ranging from the size of a large apple to the size of a small diode. The vast majority of them are sold to OEMs or other large companies, but a small direct-to-customer market exists for individuals to allow people to replace their own drivers, retrofit equipment with drivers using premade kits, or just tinker. They are constructed with proprietary materials - a closely guarded secret of the company - and appear somewhat similar to an electric motor, with an obvious difference being the single monolithic coil winding rather than the multiple windings of a motor. The major components of an EVA Driver are the outer housing, inner chassis, envirovoltaic cells, superconduction ring, stator coil, controller module, and rotor assembly. There is also an array of supercapacitors inside the chassis, the size, number, and arrangement of which depends on the size of the driver. The EV cells draw in Mystic Matter from the environment and convert it to electromotive force, which passes directly through the superconduction ring and into the stator coil. The controller module passively forces the EMF to travel through the coil in a clockwise rotation, which then turns the rotor assembly. Power from the rotor assembly is then sent back to the controller module to activate it, which then activates the superconduction ring to lower the temperature of the stator coil until superconductivity is achieved, eliminating nearly all friction and resistance. Once this process is complete, power output increases by orders of magnitude as the speed of the rotor reaches up to 12,000,000 RPM (if it is standard size). The controller module then regulates output using an advanced onboard AI, and can be pressed to manually toggle the superconduction ring, held to lock the rotor in place and halt power generation, or lifted and removed for an emergency abort. The onboard AI sends regular telemetry to Hijiya at all times as a safety measure. A failing device, be it from a malfunction or due to tampering, carries catastrophic risks, so Hijiya maintains a group of contractors to collect any drivers that broadcast a red flag for any reason, including improper shutdowns. These contractors are colloquially known as \u201credbacks\u201d due to their unnerving tactics and behavior, their outfits almost always incorporating the color red, and the red color of their identification.

Since the completion of the Avalon data center, the SensNet interface is also used to provide access to sublimation . In Q1 2029, 11K removed the purchase price for SensNet and launched a global distribution and installation initiative, with the stated aim of connecting every person alive with the SensNet service. Today, all citizens of Ilmaria are required by law to have SensNet devices, and over 80% of people in the rest of the world have had SensNet devices installed so far. How it works \u00b6 The SensNet device is installed on the back of the neck and connects directly to the brain and nervous system. Through this connection, it provides users with similar functionality to computers and smartphones by projecting audiovisual content directly into the users senses and reading user input either through physical gestures or thought commands. By default, information is presented through augmented reality as though there are intangible \u201cscreens\u201d within the user\u2019s field of view that require pseudo-physical interaction. Many of these projections are synchronized with all SensNet users, allowing people to see what others are doing to a degree, or for users to share content with others easily. Individual users can choose to disable this function, and can fully customize their experience. The device can also use the senses of the user to record video of their surroundings as they perceive them, create a projection of the user\u2019s face and body that can be used in video communications with other users without need for an external camera, provide neural guidance to artificially enhance the user\u2019s skill with certain tasks or be used as a learning tool, and more. The device is powered primarily by four redundant power cells, but also receives residual power from the nervous system. Each power cell is rated to last five to eight years. Four are present even though only one is needed due to the way the SensNet device is installed, as a complete loss of power to the device would result in the user losing all neural function outside of the brain itself. Should all four power cells cease functioning, the residual power from the nervous system is enough only to maintain the user\u2019s regular neural function and send an emergency signal to 11K so that the power cells may be replaced by local emergency services as soon as possible. The virtual reality functionality of SensNet fully intercepts all of the user\u2019s sensory signals, effectively placing users fully inside of an avatar in a virtual world. Due to the immense complexity of programming software to be aware of an entire brain, very few games and other experiences exist for this platform, but those that do are immensely popular. Users are required to lie on their backs before this functionality can be used to prevent injury. Sublimation is an extension of the virtual reality functionality, utilizing the direct connection to digitally replicate the unique consciousness of a given user and allow it to persist within a digital avatar after the death of the user\u2019s physical body. The center of the device is a cylindrical module that can be swapped out for other modules with different functionality at the user\u2019s choice. The module included by default with every installation has three card slots so that the user may expand the storage of the device, share data with other users by swapping cards, or use multiple device profiles by swapping cards. Other modules offered by 11K include radio modules, security modules, computer interfaces, and more, all of which also include at least one card slot. Removing the module also allows the user to directly connect their brains to external devices through the use of a two-way 93 pin cable. Installation \u00b6 The SensNet device is installed over a two day process, though nearly all of this time is simply the recovery period after the surgical procedure. The procedure begins by placing the user under general anesthesia, then rolling them onto their stomach. Using a surgical robot, a circular hole of 24 millimeter diameter is then opened in the back of the user\u2019s neck, where the core of the SensNet device is then pressed in until it makes contact with the spinal cord. Four power cell receptacles are then inserted around the perimeter of the core, before the flexible face plate of the device is placed over the area and surgically attached to the skin. The power cells are then inserted and the device powered on, at which point the spinal cord is automatically severed and each end connected directly to the SensNet core. The final step of the procedure is the insertion of a syringe through the core and the injection of a nanomachine cluster that closes and seals the hole the syringe was inserted from before connecting the 93 pins of the device\u2019s connector to the correct parts of the spinal cord, then begins working through the body and creating connections between the SensNet core and every single nerve in the body and neuron in the brain with cables no thicker than one nanometer. The user is then moved to a hospital bed and woken up, spending the next two days laying down and recovering from the procedure. In the first hour awake, the user will experience extreme difficulty moving any part of their body other than their face. Once their motor functions begin to return in the next two to three hours, they will experience a lack of coordination and balance that will recover over the course of approximately 12 hours. Typically, this recovery finishes either in the user\u2019s sleep, or before they go to sleep at all. The second day of their stay in the hospital bed is simply to ensure their safety as the nanomachines are flushed from the body. Installation of SensNet is permanent and irreversible. The device can be deactivated, but it cannot be removed from the body due to its deep integration with the host nervous system. Reception \u00b6 Public reception of SensNet when it was first announced was skeptical and mixed, especially surrounding the installation procedure, but reception quickly became positive once the devices made their way into public hands, with most people believing that they could not imaging returning to a life without the product. A significant minority of skeptics remained consistently prominent around the world, and over time, slowly grew in numbers. Skeptics primarily cite concerns regarding the always-online internet connection that users cannot control, the closed black-box nature of the software, and the centralization of all personal and identifying information in 11K servers. In a particularly high profile case of criticism and rejection, the Children of the Flame officially banned its members from having SensNet devices installed, claiming that the technology is an insult to the gods and its users will not be spared on the day of reckoning. Regardless of the criticism and skepticism, the overwhelming majority of people now believe that SensNet is the most important technological advancement yet in living memory, with some even going so far to claim that SensNet is the first step towards the next phase of human evolution.

Sublimation is a technology service introduced in Q4 2027 provided by 11K through the SensNet interface that creates a living digital copy of the user within the Avalon data center. This digital existence persists after the physical death of the user, effectively granting the user immortality. It was a paid service that required a hefty upfront fee and ongoing subscription or a special grant to use, but it became free to start for all in Q4 2032 in exchange for the sublimated users\u2019 ongoing performance of various tasks, in essence making them digital employees of 11K. The process is a tightly guarded secret, nobody outside of a select few within 11K are aware of how it works. By default, each user of sublimation is given a digital avatar that is a near-perfect recreation of their physical body minus any physically disabling conditions. However, users have the opportunity to request customizations before the process begins, which can be anything from changing their eye color to changing every aspect of the body into something new. SensNet power users who have experience working with its software have also been known to be capable of modifying their own bodies however and whenever they wish, regardless of any restrictions that have been applied. Reception \u00b6 Public reception was immediately and overwhelmingly positive when sublimation was first announced, the thought of achieving effective immortality being deeply tantalizing. After the service launched, however, it quickly became wildly controversial, with many people still being amazed by the idea of immortality while others began to question the motives of the company, and debates surrounding what it means to be alive and the nature of consciousness erupted around the world with renewed perspective and urgency. Criticism \u00b6 Sublimation was originally only available for a hefty fee and an ongoing subscription. Many saw this as class discrimination, as the fees were prohibitively expensive for all but the richest few in the world. After sublimation became free to start under the condition that users perform work for 11K indefinitely to remain sublimated, the service was hit with a whirlwind of controversy once again, as many people equated this to slavery. Many people around the world do not believe that sublimation is truly a continuation of one\u2019s life, but is instead an entirely separate entity from the user. All kinds of conclusions are drawn by different people following this belief, most commonly among them being the belief that the sublimated copies of their loved ones are impostors, causing emotional turmoil on both sides.

So I didn\u2019t. Everything in this world is influenced heavily by various parts of the real world, and it\u2019s no secret. If you want to create something new for the world and you want to know where to look for inspiration, this page is here to place influences on the map politically, as well as for the Cultures & Ethnicities of the world. Warning It is important to keep in mind that just because all these people and places are based heavily on the real world, they are still fictional . A lot of real-world history does not exist here, and a lot of creative liberty must be taken. Original ideas are just as important as the real-world sources, this page only serves to list sources of influence , not of 1-to-1 recreations. Some cultural stereotypes may also be written to quickly convey a theme in a simple way, but they are under no circumstances to be portrayed as derogatory or at the expense of others, nor is that ever the intention, so while you should not take them overly seriously or read too deeply into them if/where they are present, please contribute suggestions and reasoning for improvements if you have any. Corstaea represents Norway, Finland, Iceland, Faroe Islands, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Ireland. Carlow specifically represents the Celtic nations. Tolred was once a Grennerian colony before being claimed by Corstaea, leading to a unique mixture of Finnish and Russian culture in much of the modern populace. The indigenous people of Tolred, however, represent the Greenlandic Inuit. Finland is represented in southern Tolred and northern Vallastad , and Norway in the rest of Vallastad, Torstr\u00f8m , and Halstrand . The island of Jomsg\u00e5rd specifically represents Iceland. Sarrac is an autonomous territory representing the Faroe Islands. Germany is represented in Affolstein , Hartmond , and most of Allenthal . Finally, the non-Celtic parts of the United Kingdom (pretty much just England) are represented in Vinesse , Manden , and northeastern Allenthal. Destrea primarily represents Italy and Spain, but also Mexico, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Cuba, Jamaica, Melanesia, Micronesia, and Brazil. The group of islands off the southern coast of the country specifically represent Micronesia and Melanesia. None of the many cultures found on those islands are officially recognized by Destrea, and they are largely left alone today, but were the primary source of people for the slave trade in early history. Jamaica, Haiti, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic are all represented in what is now Selva Luce . Before the formation of Destrea, Selva Luce was four separate nations and had more land. Tensions are extremely high here as Destrean oppression is slowly eroding their cultures, which are not officially recognized as separate by the government. Italy is represented primarily in Vaceniza , with Rome being mirrored by the city of Alessa . All roads in Destrea and much of Ustonia eventually lead there. Begliano , Nalano , and Mugenno also represent primarily Italian culture. Spain is represented primarily in Savorra , but also extends through Alcaras , northern Filimeni , and eastern Casezzo . Mexico is represented in Destrea by the western regions of Tarence and Casezzo, and extends into Ustonia. More on that in the Ustonia section below. All Destrean prefectures were once sovereign nations with their own territories, which is how so many different real-world cultures are prominent in this country. Everything that hasn\u2019t been specifically named above - including additional Latin American cultures - can be anywhere in small numbers, and that will develop over time, but Italian culture is strong throughout most of the south, and Spanish in the north. While the many unique cultures are prominent and celebrated by the people to this day, the country is now politically most similar to fascist Italy. Grenneria represents primarily Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Czech Republic, Croatia, Slovenia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Belarus, Latvia, and Romania. Khotka , however, represents Portugal and Galicia. It was first settled by people from what is now Destrea and developed independently very early in history, before being taken by Grenneria much later. There is notable Romanian influence, but the Portuguese and Galician cultures remain intact and dominant. Romania is represented specifically by Nazavat . Ukraine is represented specifically by Ulavyr . Roslaya primarily represents Russia, and the whole country is primarily Russian in political style and influence. Polish and Czech culture are both represented primarily in Kielda . Croatian and Slovene culture are both represented primarily in Sarabey . Serbian and Bulgarian culture are both represented primarily in Markask . Belarusian and Latvian culture are both represented primarily in Ivashni . Other Slavic cultures may also be placed throughout the country in small numbers, but exactly which and where they are will develop over time. Osun Tanum primarily represents Sweden, while also representing Denmark, Austria, Belgium, Netherlands, and Hungary. Hungary is represented almost exclusively in the southeast region of Elg\u00e5rd , Austria in Vastdal , Belgium in Macdon , and Netherlands in Osterfeld . While the culture is dominantly Swedish throughout the country, Danish culture mixes in more and more the farther south you go. Of the eight large countries, this one has the most fictional aspects to it, explaining Osun Tanum\u2019s near-utopian government and society. Sangyon primarily represents South Korea, while also representing Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, and the Philippines. Singapore is specifically represented in Tanje , Thailand in Tanbaek , Indonesia in Jeonsan , and the Philippines in Cheosu . South Korean influence is present in all of them. The northwest corner of this country - mainly Rasan and Ranan - was also settled by Corstaean people early in history, and includes a small but notable mixture of Norwegian culture as a result. Since Shinzen was once an empire that ruled over this entire country, some Japanese influence on the culture is still present in small ways. Shaohou primarily represents China, while also representing Mongolia, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Malaysia. Malaysia is represented exclusively in Suwei , and Vietnam in Xinwei . Mongolian and Cambodian culture and people are spread thin throughout all of Shaohou. Unlike China, the Han people are not the overwhelming majority of Shaohou. They are still the majority, but there is a lot more diversity throughout the country. Since Shinzen was once an empire that ruled over this entire country, some Japanese influence on the culture is still present in small ways. Shinzen primarily represents Japan, while also representing Taiwan and Hong Kong. Taiwan is specifically represented by Futou , and Hong Kong by Onsai . These states were part of Shaohou until relatively recently, so Japanese influence on these states is minimal, but present. The Ainu people are indigenous to and represented mainly in Tozawa with some presence in the south of Sumitori as well. They are much more prominent here than in reality, but are still a very small and fractured minority. The Ryukyuan people are indigenous to and represented mainly in Okina with some presence in the south of Sumitori as well. Unlike reality, they are officially recognized and were not subject to cultural suppression by Shinzen. All of the regions of Japan have a specific place here. Kiyoshiri represents Ky\u016bsh\u016b (with Satsuma retaining particular prominence), Kenshiri represents Shikoku, Hayagawa represents Ch\u016bgoku, Sumitori represents Kansai, Tozawa represents Hokkaid\u014d, Okina represents the Ryukyu islands, Asahi represents Kant\u014d, Kuminachi represents T\u014dhoku, and Miwae represents Ch\u016bbu. One major difference from these regions, however, is that the city and culture of Kyoto is represented by Soukotan in Miwae, rather than in Sumitori with the rest of the Kansai region. Additionally, the Hayato people are represented in Kiyoshiri, and the Azumi people in Kenshiri, even though both were from Ky\u016bsh\u016b, and the many dialects of Japanese are represented here more by ethnicity than by region. More on that on the Shisuya page. Ustonia primarily represents the USA, while also representing Canada, Australia, and Polynesia. Isla Sofia is a completely self sustained island that specifically represents Polynesia, most prominently M\u0101ori people. Its name comes from Destrean colonization attempts, and Ustonia chose to use that name when annexing the land. The native name of the land is unknown (or TBD). Canada is represented almost exclusively in Lonfolk , Exford , and Norston , while South Macdon is primarily Belgian with some Canadian influence. Similarly, West Vastdal is primarily Austrian with some Australian influence. Australia is represented almost exclusively in Morwick , Oxbalt , and Corburn . Prestona and Verace , having recently defected from Destrea, have dominant Mexican culture not found anywhere else in Ustonia. Ustonia, as you may be able to guess, is a colonized nation. While representing the named countries, it also prominently represents the indigenous peoples of them as minority groups, many with their own reservations. All of these indigenous cultures can be anywhere, and that will develop over time. Alastor and Ilmaria are the only completely fictional locations on the map with no major real-world connections of their own, albeit still influenced in part by the people that live there - Icelandic and Danish for Alastor, Japanese and American for Ilmaria. Some particularly important differences from reality to consider with your influences are: Some of the real-world countries represented by Destrea have ties with the EU, but the closest equivalent in this world is the Ozen Federation , which Destrea is not a part of. Any multinational EU projects you would like to reference should instead be part of the Ozen Federation. Destrea could still be a customer for these programs though. For example, the Eurofighter Typhoon would be a product of the Ozen Federation in this world, and Destrea would play no part in that program, even though Spain and Italy are project managers for it in the real world. This world had its Nazi Germany-esque event in its history, and Germany is represented in Corstaea. However, in this world, that event and all the weird technology that came with it happened in Destrea instead. France isn\u2019t really represented anywhere in this world, but French technological developments should be treated as Destrean in this world. Unlike reality, where much of east Asia migrated from what is now China, the people of Sangyon, Shaohou, and Shinzen are all native to their lands. There is also no Chinese influence outside of Shaohou, Futou, and Onsai, but there is some Japanese influence throughout the continent due to empire of Shinzen ruling over the entire continent for a time. Grenneria may represent Russia in part, but Grenneria has a floundering aviation sector. Shinzen, meanwhile, is dominant in this field. As such, major Russian aviation companies (Sukhoi, Mikoyan, Ilyushin, Irkut, Tupolev, Yakovlev,) should instead be considered part of Shinzen. When it comes to brand names, you can use real-world ones for convenience, as long as you use a Meta admonition to state that you\u2019re doing so. All real-world brand names must be fictionalized in all canon in-world content, so any real-world names will only ever exist on this wiki as points of reference. Check and use the List of fictionalized real-world brand names . Linguistically, global development in this world should be considered greatly simplified due to the smaller overall population and higher population density, despite cultural development remaining (somewhat) realistically diverse. In fact, the linguistic development of this world is extremely un realistic when compared to reality, considering that many of the languages located near each other geographically have quite little in common linguistically, but that could be thanks at least in part to those pesky gods meddling in people\u2019s affairs 1 , so I think that\u2019s fine. More on handling languages can be read here . Culturally, I\u2019m fully aware that there are a lot of real-world cultures not mentioned here - most of the planet has been left out! - and that there\u2019s a lot more detail that could be expanded from what has been mentioned above. This combined with the extremely limited number of major ethnic groups in this world is a conscious decision in an effort to keep the scope of the world manageable, so it should be theoretically possible for anyone to learn the essentials of almost everything about it in a day or two, even as the world grows. Don\u2019t let that stop you from adding representation for more real-world cultures and ethnicities! That would be a very welcome addition! Just keep the above in mind if you do that. Try to write new cultures or ethnicities as minority subgroups within an existing larger group, or provide detailed history on their origins plus when and how/why they became a minority. Creating a new major group with greater numbers isn\u2019t entirely off the table, but will require a strong case to consider the myriad potential effects throughout the history of the world. Also, since there isn\u2019t currently a more suitable place to put this note, all animals that exist in the real world exist in this world too. Some that have gone extinct in the real world may not be extinct here, and vice versa. It\u2019s also entirely possible to create completely original creatures that don\u2019t exist in the real world, as long as they\u2019re relatively believable, and in fact some original creatures would be pretty cool since there are so many possibilities for how mystic matter could affect animals in this world.

Anyway, everything that the various pages in the cultures and ethnicities section say is \u201csuggested\u201d is true. It is also true that all the world\u2019s ethnicities come from the seven major groups, but several of the subgroups \u201cthought to\u201d be new developments did in fact exist since Era Dira, and Carlanders really are the first of the Exilans like they were \u201cthought to\u201d be, and the Farodet story of \u201cemerging from the mountains\u201d was spot on. The people who survived The End of Everything were sheltered within Himlav\u00e5rd, and then at the beginning of Anno Ortu, most of the people were teleported to their places around the world, but the Farodet, Exilan, and Irovell people walked out of the mountains themselves. Knowing all that, though, don\u2019t get used to the idea of things that are \u201cthought to be\u201d or \u201csuggested\u201d to be true actually being true, because some of the information on this wiki is deliberately incorrect due to being written from the human perspective without the knowledge of true events. \u21a9","title":"Appropriate real world influences"},{"location":"Nova-Regna/_meta/On%20the%20gender%20and%20sexuality%20of%20characters/","text":"If you look at the Character profile template, you will see that there is no gender field, only pronouns, and that there is also a sexuality field despite the usefulness of that being questionable at best. While this page in itself could also be considered unnecessary by some, allow me to explain my thought process for the inclusion and usage of these fields. First, the pronouns field. Quite simply, I do not believe that gender is important (or even relevant in many situations) to a story unless it is made a core part of said story. It is, however, important to some readers/viewers for their own reasons, be them good or bad. The simplest thing to do then is to list only the pronouns of a character on their page, unless gender identity is a core element of that character\u2019s story. For the characters I write, they may have a particular gender in my head as I start writing with them, but that\u2019s no law. Cis or trans, binary or nonbinary, it doesn\u2019t matter, everyone is free to imagine characters in the way that feels right to them , and if the lack of a set in stone canon gender bothers someone, that\u2019s their own problem that they can deal with alone. And if the thought of a character being trans or non-binary bothers someone, or the usage of pronouns in this manner bothers someone, they will probably not be welcome here for long. Next, sexuality. Frankly, this is even less important or relevant than gender in most situations if you ask me. That said, not only does the same logic as above apply here too, I also personally find it useful to have this in mind when I try to get inside the head of a character and write for them, even when it doesn\u2019t seem relevant, because it can influence a character\u2019s behavior in subtle (and not-so-subtle) ways. That\u2019s why I assign sexuality to my characters, even when it\u2019s not part of their stories. And as it turns out, this wiki happens to be mine, so things that I do only for my own brain will end up listed here. However, even though I include those fields, I almost never consider them set in stone. Same as before, it\u2019s only set in stone if sexuality is a core part of the story. Otherwise, you\u2019re free to ignore the field if you\u2019d like. The listed sexuality can also change in the future for some characters depending on how things develop. So again, unless sexuality is a core part of the story, you can imagine the characters of this world in whatever way feels right to you . But that\u2019s all just me. As for characters created by people other than myself, the respective authors may have different views than I do on this matter, so they may really intend for their characters to be set in stone. Maybe in the future if this wiki grows big enough, I\u2019ll add other authors\u2019 thoughts to this page to keep it all in one place, but for now, if you want to create a character in this world and want their gender and/or sexuality to be set in stone, please state that somewhere on the character page, or remove the fields entirely if you would rather not use them. Author info Kit - (AKA Kerosyn, or QuickFastly) Web zone // Twitter","title":"On the gender and sexuality of characters"},{"location":"Nova-Regna/_meta/On%20the%20languages%20of%20the%20world/","text":"Until the day someone goes hog wild and creates a large handful of fictional languages just for this world, real-world languages will be used. However, this will be handled in a specific way. Real-world languages shall not be named at any point in any stories set in this world, nor on any page of this wiki, except those in the Cultures & Ethnicities section. Personally, I do want to define fictional languages for this world one day, even if they end up just being modified versions of real languages, but it\u2019s extremely low on my list of priorities. Using real-world etymology to create names for fictional people and places doesn\u2019t bother me, but despite that, I find it awkward and uncomfortable to use the real names of real-world languages in a fictional world with none of the same people, places, or development. For the time being, the languages of this world will be given names and nothing more. So, for example, take the Chiyan people of Sangyon. For all intents and purposes, their language is the same as Korean and their page specifies as such, but rather than writing \u201cKorean\u201d anywhere, their language has been named \u201cNalamal\u201d instead, so you can write either that or \u201cThe Chiyan language\u201d to refer to it. However, writing some things in Korean is perfectly fine and welcomed. In spoken dialogue, especially if the given language has not yet been named, you may also use the name of the given ethnicity as the name of the language, because \u201cI don\u2019t speak Chiyan\u201d sounds much more natural out loud than \u201cI don\u2019t speak the Chiyan language\u201d doesn\u2019t it? That may be considered offensive in some parts of the world though, so keep that in mind too. This applies absolutely on the wiki, and I strongly recommend that you follow this policy in any other content as well. Either that, or make your own language and make a page for it here too. As a result of this, English as we know it is not a language in the world. This wiki is written in English, most content based in the world will probably be in English, but the characters do not speak English, they speak their own languages that we don\u2019t know. So essentially, everything about this world is a localization. Some figures of speech that make sense to us may not exist in this world, but we can use them anyway for our convenience. So unless you intend to actually create their language, don\u2019t overthink your word choices, you\u2019re \u201clocalizing\u201d the content and have a lot of wiggle room. As a fun little bonus of that logic, measurement systems that we\u2019re familiar with in the real world can also be used here, even though the people of this world probably have their own systems that we don\u2019t know. Author info Kit - (AKA Kerosyn, or QuickFastly) Web zone // Twitter","title":"On the languages of the world"},{"location":"Nova-Regna/_meta/On%20the%20soul%2C%20living%20or%20otherwise/","text":"You\u2019re probably familiar with the concept of humans possessing a separate soul inside them, one that continues to live after death, as an explanation for afterlife. Well, in this world, those really do exist, and they are (relatively) physical objects made of Mystic Matter . All living things in this world, and everything they create, are inherently intertwined with mystic matter. Without it, there would be no life, there may not even be existence at all. It could be said, then, that in a way, everything that exists is part of the same greater whole, whether anyone or anything is aware of that or not. Souls are the tangible evidence of this fact. However\u2026 Nobody in the world but the gods are aware of that fact, or even the existence of souls. The discovery of mystic matter is very recent, just barely half a century old, and studies still have yet to really figure out the matter itself, so nobody has yet been able to investigate the mystic matter coursing through people in detail. Why? Because I like mystery, the unexplained, and unanswerable questions. Even though mystic matter follows rules and serves a specific purpose in this world, I think it\u2019s much more interesting if the people in this world don\u2019t have the same understanding we do. Leaves the door open for more wonder, confusion, and awe. Nonetheless, souls exist, and you can take advantage of them. People (and all conscious life) \u00b6 When a baby is conceived in this world, they absorb small amounts of mystic matter throughout the pregnancy, mainly from the surrounding area but some from the mother as well. This performs two functions: helping the baby develop healthily, and growing its soul. For this reason, babies born in areas with low concentrations of mystic matter in the atmosphere are more likely to be disabled, deformed, stillborn, or miscarried, and babies born in areas with high concentrations are more likely to develop alignment or attunement , and this also explains how those abilities can be influenced by heredity. Spirits tend to develop much stronger souls than humans or other animals due to the fact that they all have a natural affinity with mystic matter, so they can be carried in less hospitable environments without much issue. How healthy the soul is after initial development has dramatic effects on the child\u2019s health for the rest of their life. It functions as an invisible copy of the person, both physical and mental. When a body heals from an injury, it\u2019s essentially replacing the damaged parts with the healthy copy stored in the soul. Some people heal faster or slower than average, and this is why. Of course, there comes a point where things become too much to heal, especially with mental health. It takes a lot of physical and unconscious mental energy to perform the healing process, so when a physical injury saps too much energy or the brain is damaged, it can overwhelm the body and soul and drastically slow the healing process, sometimes resulting in death for the person before they can heal. 1 Injuries or brain damage that\u2019s too extreme - like losing a limb or experiencing a brain hemorrhage - or even a case of extreme depression and self-isolation that goes unchecked for too long can also damage the soul directly, and therefore become irreparable. With that said, it\u2019s important to note that this is NOT meant to be a supernatural thing. Real-world health risks and consequences all still apply. Things that are incurable, irreparable, or impossible to heal in the real world are the same in this world too, the healing process just takes a slightly different path to the same result. Diseases such as cancer in this world can still become terminal, because after too long, the soul becomes diseased as well. Fast healers may be able to reach almost supernatural healing abilities, though. For example, the most exceptional of people may be able to heal a broken bone in half the average time, recover from blood loss much faster than normal, or get over a bad cold overnight. Maybe this would also give them a crazy high alcohol tolerance, who knows? Point is, they are absolutely NOT invincible or immune to anything. Unlike real-world ideas of the soul, it has no active influence on the person, it is merely a copy of them. A literal interpretation of \u201cself-image\u201d in essence. All of this also applies just the same to any other creatures with the quality of consciousness. Some animals may even rarely develop abilities and intelligence beyond the normal capabilities of their species - even to supernatural or mythical extents - if their soul is developed enough by exposure to mystic matter, or other particularly strong souls. Objects (and all other life) \u00b6 Have you ever heard someone describe something they own as \u201chaving soul\u201d before? Maybe a houseplant that\u2019s been with the family through thick and thin, a car that was with a person from adolescence to adulthood and beyond, or a huge rock that\u2019s been in the middle of town for generations. That\u2019s essentially a form of animism , and in this world, it\u2019s reality. No object inherently has a soul, but mystic matter flows through everything regardless. In close proximity to people and animals, pieces of their souls \u201crub off\u201d on the objects, and the objects slowly develop souls of their own. Being inanimate, their soul can\u2019t be expressed obviously, but it\u2019s \u201cvisible\u201d to those who believe in it. A single tree in a blighted forest that refuses to die. A car that seems to respond differently only for its owner. A shield that stays strong through difficult odds, despite being made of weaker materials. These are effects of an object\u2019s soul, influenced by their surroundings, how they\u2019re treated, and their purpose. This is also how some forests might feel deeply unsettling to be in, or mysteriously pleasant, depending on what has happened within them over the centuries. It is entirely possible to form a deep bond with a plant or inanimate object if you spent enough time with it, expressing your emotions to it. The bond will be mutual. What kind of effect this bond has on both parties and how strong it is, is up to you. As long as you make it believable, it can be anything. Remember though, nobody knows these souls really exist. Particularly mystical people, like sages and druids and the like, will probably have a sense of what\u2019s going on, and may even use the word \u201csoul\u201d to describe it, but won\u2019t be able to accurately explain the true nature of this reality. Paranormality \u00b6 The souls of inanimate objects take on the traits of their surroundings with influence from their treatment. Souls of the living are invisible copies of those beings. Since souls are physical objects themselves, they tend to die with their hosts. But what if they didn\u2019t? In some very rare cases, a soul may persist after the death or destruction of its host. This can be caused by a number of things, and can manifest in a number of ways. For people, their soul might remain if their death was sudden and unexpected, and the person had attunement. It might remain if they died in immense agony, or while holding a profound anger. It might remain if the person simply wished strongly enough that they could say goodbye to someone, apologize for something, or see their child grow up. The lower the concentration of mystic matter in the atmosphere, the more likely it is for a strong soul to remain, but even then it\u2019s still extremely rare. It\u2019s also possible for a person\u2019s soul to be absorbed by a nearby object if it, too, has a soul, especially if the person and the object had formed a bond. These possessed objects can display extremely strange changes, even appearing magical, especially if it\u2019s a living thing like a plant. Perhaps it\u2019s a seasonal flower that blooms forever, or a tree that bears fruit year round. It may also cause negative effects, like a tree that sucks the life out of all the plants surrounding it, or a car that appears to force its driver into accidents. When an inanimate object\u2019s soul persists, it will almost always cause negative effects, as though the object is punishing the world for destroying it. How likely this is to happen depends entirely on the strength of the object\u2019s soul, and its bonds if it has any. Souls can\u2019t develop after being separated from their hosts, and they will degrade over time. This could manifest as a soul that loses its memories until eventually fading away entirely, a soul that gets more and more manic until burning itself out, or any other number of things, but they can never form uniquely new traits otherwise. Their time is over, there is no arc to be had. Once again though, I must remind you that all of this paranormal activity is incredibly rare. If you use this in something you create, go wild, be creative with it, just remember to make it believable. You should try to avoid letting this appear too often though. Save it for situations where it can carry some serious weight, because chances are if anything paranormal happens anywhere in the world and anyone notices, it will become a legend that sticks around for centuries. Finally, since souls are made of mystic matter, people with alignment can perceive these paranormal souls. This will give them a unique perspective on the situation, and might even allow them to interact with the soul. Perhaps they can find a way to dispel it forcefully, or maybe they show compassion and give the soul comfort. At the very least, people with alignment will have far less fear of these souls than anyone else, even though they don\u2019t really know what they truly are.

This performs two functions: helping the baby develop healthily, and growing its soul. For this reason, babies born in areas with low concentrations of mystic matter in the atmosphere are more likely to be disabled, deformed, stillborn, or miscarried, and babies born in areas with high concentrations are more likely to develop alignment or attunement , and this also explains how those abilities can be influenced by heredity. Spirits tend to develop much stronger souls than humans or other animals due to the fact that they all have a natural affinity with mystic matter, so they can be carried in less hospitable environments without much issue. How healthy the soul is after initial development has dramatic effects on the child\u2019s health for the rest of their life. It functions as an invisible copy of the person, both physical and mental. When a body heals from an injury, it\u2019s essentially replacing the damaged parts with the healthy copy stored in the soul. Some people heal faster or slower than average, and this is why. Of course, there comes a point where things become too much to heal, especially with mental health. It takes a lot of physical and unconscious mental energy to perform the healing process, so when a physical injury saps too much energy or the brain is damaged, it can overwhelm the body and soul and drastically slow the healing process, sometimes resulting in death for the person before they can heal. 1 Injuries or brain damage that\u2019s too extreme - like losing a limb or experiencing a brain hemorrhage - or even a case of extreme depression and self-isolation that goes unchecked for too long can also damage the soul directly, and therefore become irreparable. With that said, it\u2019s important to note that this is NOT meant to be a supernatural thing. Real-world health risks and consequences all still apply. Things that are incurable, irreparable, or impossible to heal in the real world are the same in this world too, the healing process just takes a slightly different path to the same result. Diseases such as cancer in this world can still become terminal, because after too long, the soul becomes diseased as well. Fast healers may be able to reach almost supernatural healing abilities, though. For example, the most exceptional of people may be able to heal a broken bone in half the average time, recover from blood loss much faster than normal, or get over a bad cold overnight. Maybe this would also give them a crazy high alcohol tolerance, who knows? Point is, they are absolutely NOT invincible or immune to anything. Unlike real-world ideas of the soul, it has no active influence on the person, it is merely a copy of them. A literal interpretation of \u201cself-image\u201d in essence. All of this also applies just the same to any other creatures with the quality of consciousness. Some animals may even rarely develop abilities and intelligence beyond the normal capabilities of their species - even to supernatural or mythical extents - if their soul is developed enough by exposure to mystic matter, or other particularly strong souls.","title":"People (and all conscious life)"},{"location":"Nova-Regna/_meta/On%20the%20soul%2C%20living%20or%20otherwise/#objects-and-all-other-life","text":"Have you ever heard someone describe something they own as \u201chaving soul\u201d before? Maybe a houseplant that\u2019s been with the family through thick and thin, a car that was with a person from adolescence to adulthood and beyond, or a huge rock that\u2019s been in the middle of town for generations. That\u2019s essentially a form of animism , and in this world, it\u2019s reality. No object inherently has a soul, but mystic matter flows through everything regardless. In close proximity to people and animals, pieces of their souls \u201crub off\u201d on the objects, and the objects slowly develop souls of their own. Being inanimate, their soul can\u2019t be expressed obviously, but it\u2019s \u201cvisible\u201d to those who believe in it. A single tree in a blighted forest that refuses to die. A car that seems to respond differently only for its owner. A shield that stays strong through difficult odds, despite being made of weaker materials. These are effects of an object\u2019s soul, influenced by their surroundings, how they\u2019re treated, and their purpose. This is also how some forests might feel deeply unsettling to be in, or mysteriously pleasant, depending on what has happened within them over the centuries. It is entirely possible to form a deep bond with a plant or inanimate object if you spent enough time with it, expressing your emotions to it. The bond will be mutual. What kind of effect this bond has on both parties and how strong it is, is up to you. As long as you make it believable, it can be anything. Remember though, nobody knows these souls really exist. Particularly mystical people, like sages and druids and the like, will probably have a sense of what\u2019s going on, and may even use the word \u201csoul\u201d to describe it, but won\u2019t be able to accurately explain the true nature of this reality.","title":"Objects (and all other life)"},{"location":"Nova-Regna/_meta/On%20the%20soul%2C%20living%20or%20otherwise/#paranormality","text":"The souls of inanimate objects take on the traits of their surroundings with influence from their treatment.

In some very rare cases, a soul may persist after the death or destruction of its host. This can be caused by a number of things, and can manifest in a number of ways. For people, their soul might remain if their death was sudden and unexpected, and the person had attunement. It might remain if they died in immense agony, or while holding a profound anger. It might remain if the person simply wished strongly enough that they could say goodbye to someone, apologize for something, or see their child grow up. The lower the concentration of mystic matter in the atmosphere, the more likely it is for a strong soul to remain, but even then it\u2019s still extremely rare. It\u2019s also possible for a person\u2019s soul to be absorbed by a nearby object if it, too, has a soul, especially if the person and the object had formed a bond.

One might even call it magic, who would have guessed? All living things in this world, and everything they create, are inherently intertwined with mystic matter. Without it, there would be no life, there may not even be existence at all. It could be said, then, that in a way, everything that exists is part of the same greater whole, whether anyone or anything is aware of that or not. Theoretically, absolutely anything is possible through the use of mystic matter. However\u2026 Nobody in the world but the gods are aware of that fact, or even a fragment of its true potential. The discovery of mystic matter is very recent, just barely half a century old, and studies still have yet to really figure out the matter itself, so nobody has yet been able to investigate the mystic matter coursing through people in detail. Why? Because I like mystery, the unexplained, and unanswerable questions. Even though mystic matter follows some rules and serves a specific purpose in this world, I think it\u2019s much more interesting if the people in this world don\u2019t have the same understanding we do. Leaves the door open for more wonder, confusion, and awe. If you want to write a character with attunement, you need to keep the following things in mind. Source of power \u00b6 Attunement, as an ability, runs mainly on two things: The user\u2019s imagination, and their ability to think abstractly against common logic and reason. This means that the type of \u201cmagic\u201d a user is capable of is dependent in large part on their personality, and if anything, their lack of scientific knowledge. Their ability is a deep part of them, and may say a lot about them. The reason having less knowledge may be beneficial to a user is because they will have less to think about, and therefore less logic to defy, reducing the cognitive load. On the other hand, extensive knowledge in a field of science could also influence the user\u2019s ability in its own way. For instance, one person may develop a magnet-like ability if they studied magnets a lot and find themselves incapable of using it on anything that isn\u2019t naturally magnetic, while another person may develop a similar ability that they can use on all metals, magnetic or not, if they grew up uneducated in the middle of nowhere. It is extremely difficult, but not completely impossible, for a user to teach another their techniques and abilities. The main exception to this rule is for those raised under strict hereditary tradition, like the people of the Inazuma Clan for example, but the incredibly vast majority of people with attunement will learn and develop entirely on their own. The only other consideration for where this power comes from is that it\u2019s based on the manipulation of mystic matter, a physical substance that exists in the world. This ability doesn\u2019t create new matter, it uses existing mystic matter to reshape into what the user desires, or to perform otherwise impossible tasks. If you want to overthink it, the main aspects of this usage are quantum fields and antimatter annihilation, and there\u2019s way more antimatter to exploit in this reality due to mystic matter being 50% antimatter, but you should only think about all that if you think it\u2019s fun to overthink, this isn\u2019t real science and it doesn\u2019t have to follow real rules. Some areas of the world have higher or lower concentrations of this matter than normal, and that will have an effect on attunement users in those areas. Less proficient users may find themselves completely unable to use their abilities in particularly desolate regions. An additional important consideration would be whether or not the user also has Alignment . Not all do, and someone without alignment is far less likely to ever discover their attunement, and it will be harder to learn. Also remember that mystic matter itself is a very recent discovery in the world. If you plan to write anything that takes place before the late 20th century, pretty much everyone in the world will believe it\u2019s magic, witchcraft, divine, or demonic, and that might be taboo in some areas. Even for some time after the discovery, it took a while for the rest of the world to catch up and realize that it\u2019s not magic, and for the taboos to fade away. Finally, it\u2019s important to consider that attunement has historically been a rare enough ability that the world is not built to support it. Nowhere in the world is it an expected ability, nothing requires it, and military development largely ignored it. Some militaries may have experimented with attunement both offensively and defensively, but it never came close to large scale adoption, so almost every battle notably involving it would become a major historical event. Elements \u00b6 Many proficient users will find themselves developing an affinity for an \u201celement\u201d like fire, water, electricity, and so forth. This is NOT a functional mechanic. Let me repeat that. This world\u2019s \u201cmagic\u201d is NOT elemental AT ALL . No \u201celement\u201d has an advantage over any other, because it\u2019s an illusion. These affinities are formed entirely within the users\u2019 imaginations and have no inherent function, it\u2019s just what each user finds easiest to understand, or finds most appealing. Abandon all semblance of elemental magic systems or video game logic in your writing with this ability. I know you can be more creative than that. Fire is often weak to water in media, but why doesn\u2019t the water evaporate? Electricity is often weak to earth in media, but why doesn\u2019t the earth burn? Dark is often weak to light in media, but what does that even mean? All a user has to do in this world to overcome the idea of an elemental advantage is ask themselves why . The moment a user (OR their opponent if there is one) no longer confidently and absolutely believes they have an advantage or disadvantage, it disappears. Of course, to stop believing, they have to believe in the first place, and that kind of game logic isn\u2019t particularly prevalent in this world, so nobody believes to begin with. So, let me say it a third time just to be extra clear because I hate this trope that much. There is NO elemental magic in this world. \u201cElements\u201d can only be purely aesthetic. Limitations & Possibilities \u00b6 With elements out of the way and remembering that imagination is one of the main sources of power for this ability, it should be very clear that this ability is an opportunity to be super creative. The only limit is from the perspective of balance. It\u2019s theoretically possible for a person to become more powerful than a god with this ability, but nobody does, and nobody should, because it would destroy the balance of power for the entire world. The reason the fox spirits are the most proficient users of this ability is entirely because of how long they live and how few they are. Even with a thousand years of practice, they still struggle to even come close to the powers of the incarnations , because the incarnations are the gods . Or at least what\u2019s left of them. How you limit your character\u2019s proficiency with their attunement is open to just as much creativity as the abilities you give them. Are they too highly educated to be able to get in the mindset? Do they overthink it and fizzle out? Are they simply not creative enough? Maybe they\u2019re neurodivergent and that makes it more (or maybe less!) difficult for them than otherwise. Now with that in mind, let me bludgeon you yet again with the statement that imagination is one of the main sources of power here. How a character utilizes their attunement doesn\u2019t have to be like magic, or even visible. It could be used for psychic abilities, like limited foresight or psychometry. It could be used for communication, allowing a character to speak or read other languages at a basic level without studying them, use telepathy, or communicate with animals. It could be used to slow the character\u2019s perception of time to give them faster reaction speeds. It could make them physically stronger without them even knowing why, or slow their aging slightly without them realizing. All living things and the things they create are inherently intertwined with mystic matter, so users of attunement literally have the entire world at their fingertips. Anything you can imagine, it can be done as long as you can make it believable and maintain some amount of balance. Now, with all that in mind, there is one universal limitation to consider. The creation of living material is the most difficult thing an attunement user could possibly do, even if it\u2019s as simple as seaweed. Creating more complex things like meat would be nearly impossible for anyone to pull off, even among the oldest fox spirits. Manipulation of living material is easy, but creation of living material will nearly always fail one way or another due to the immense complexity of it. So no steak dinners appearing out of thin air! Maybe an attunement user could keep themselves alive without a food source for a while by materializing some of the base components of nutrition, but it certainly wouldn\u2019t be appetizing. A much more practical, appealing, and possible application of attunement for the creation of food would be supplying personal crops (i.e. small scale, not for mass production) with nutrients to grow food faster, or in places where it normally couldn\u2019t grow at all. Oh, by the way, stuff like ghosts? Haunted woods? That\u2019s all connected to mystic matter too in this world. It\u2019s exceedingly rare, but paranormal activity in the world can be justified with mystic matter. For instance, a ghost might be the soul of a person with attunement that remained alive after the person was murdered. Of course, this implies that souls exist - and they do. Everyone has a soul, and it\u2019s made of mystic matter. The world is not aware of this. Go wild with that one. Balance \u00b6 And finally, the topic of balance. Attunement as an ability is inherently unbalanced, no matter how weak the character is. Even if all the character can do is move a pencil on a table without touching it, that\u2019s more than the vast majority of people are capable of. Everything this ability can do is a direct advantage in some way. So what is \u201cbalanced\u201d then? Obviously one-on-one matchups against an attunement user will never be balanced, so you have to consider a larger scale. Can the character take on an army, head first? You\u2019ve gone too far. Can they take on an armed squad of eight people, unarmed? Sure, if you can make it believable. Perhaps a more interesting and believable overpowered scenario, however, would be a character that utilizes supernatural eyesight and telepathy to control a battlefield from the background as a tactician. You should also bear in mind that this ability is incredibly rare, occurring in less than 1/25,000 humans , 1/3,000 minor spirits , and 1/1,000 major spirits. Even among such small numbers, the majority of these people have weak abilities, or might not have even noticed their abilities themselves. A character with attunement is going to stand out, and the more powerful their ability, the more eyes will be on them\u2026 perhaps even drawing the attention of authorities or shadowy organizations. Remember that impact, because it wouldn\u2019t be very believable to have a character with the ability to level a building with their mind that still goes to school every day like a normal kid. At least, not if anybody knows they can do that. You may have noticed that the word \u201cbelievable\u201d has been used a lot here. In the end, that\u2019s the most important thing for this ability. It doesn\u2019t have to be realistic, it doesn\u2019t have to be fair, it doesn\u2019t even have to make logical sense, as long as you can write it in a believable way in the context of this world. Make us believe that the character should be capable of what you say they are. Expect your contributions with this ability to be reviewed on that more than anything else. Don\u2019t overthink it I guess.

Even if all the character can do is move a pencil on a table without touching it, that\u2019s more than the vast majority of people are capable of. Everything this ability can do is a direct advantage in some way. So what is \u201cbalanced\u201d then? Obviously one-on-one matchups against an attunement user will never be balanced, so you have to consider a larger scale. Can the character take on an army, head first? You\u2019ve gone too far. Can they take on an armed squad of eight people, unarmed? Sure, if you can make it believable. Perhaps a more interesting and believable overpowered scenario, however, would be a character that utilizes supernatural eyesight and telepathy to control a battlefield from the background as a tactician. You should also bear in mind that this ability is incredibly rare, occurring in less than 1/25,000 humans , 1/3,000 minor spirits , and 1/1,000 major spirits. Even among such small numbers, the majority of these people have weak abilities, or might not have even noticed their abilities themselves. A character with attunement is going to stand out, and the more powerful their ability, the more eyes will be on them\u2026 perhaps even drawing the attention of authorities or shadowy organizations. Remember that impact, because it wouldn\u2019t be very believable to have a character with the ability to level a building with their mind that still goes to school every day like a normal kid. At least, not if anybody knows they can do that. You may have noticed that the word \u201cbelievable\u201d has been used a lot here. In the end, that\u2019s the most important thing for this ability. It doesn\u2019t have to be realistic, it doesn\u2019t have to be fair, it doesn\u2019t even have to make logical sense, as long as you can write it in a believable way in the context of this world. Make us believe that the character should be capable of what you say they are. Expect your contributions with this ability to be reviewed on that more than anything else. Don\u2019t overthink it I guess.

Of course there can be as much or as little additional nuance as you choose to think about, but this should get you on the right track no matter what. The \u201cother\u201d section on this chart includes anything irregular. Private militaries, militias, espionage, whatever you can think of that doesn\u2019t fit army, navy, or air force. What do the percentages mean? What are they relative to? How much is the difference between an A and an S grade? I don\u2019t know, it doesn\u2019t really matter, it\u2019s the vaguest possible graph, it\u2019s not made for detail. If you look back more than about 110 years (from the current year of 2033 to the 1920s and earlier,) the major changes to consider are as follows: The Risky Witches does not exist prior to 1991 Ilmaria does not exist prior to 1984 The Ozen Federation does not exist prior to 1978 Destrea and Ustonia are significantly weaker. The balance between them is the same, but the Ozen nations are able to fight back much more effectively Destrea and Ustonia get weaker and weaker as you go beyond the 1920s Destrea no longer exists past 1797 Instead, each of its prefectures are their own small nations, except for Selva Luce, which splits into four even smaller nations. These nations are all quite formidable, both in tactics and technology Ustonia no longer exists past 1706 Instead, the country is largely unincorporated with three major colonies around the place settled by people of Ozen. The colonies have formidable technology but rather weak tactics, and the many groups of indigenous people are the opposite Go back another 60 or so years and the colonies no longer exist Go back to around the year 800 and three quarters of the Yulentian continent is owned by the Alessan Empire, which is the dominant global power of the time Some other things: Corstaea and Osun Tanum may not have particularly strong militaries, but in the last 60-70 years, their technological advancements outpaced their own capabilities. Because of this, they frequently participate in weapon design competitions held by Ustonia or Shinzen, where said weapons may then be primarily manufactured. Also here\u2019s a version of the current year foreign relations chart from all the country pages without any emphasis on any particular country, because I don\u2019t know where else to put it.
